Holding my arms up like this is exhausting.\u201d\n \n\u2026\n \nI hope you know none of that\u2019s true.\n \nI do pump myself up before a big lift sometimes.\n \nIt can indeed be awkward.\n \nSlaps are given. Music is played. Grunts are, embarrassing as it is in retrospect, made.\n \nBut while I use it as a tool, I don\u2019t rely on feelings of motivation, for reasons we\u2019re about to get to.\n \nThe term motivation is used and abused too much and too vaguely. Before we can talk about it, we need to firmly define what it means.\n \nWhen discussing others, most agree that motivation is \nthe desire that drives their actions.\n \nSimple, right?\n \nBut when we\u2019re talking about ourselves\u2014and perhaps most specifically when we speak of notoriously hard to improve aspects of our lives\u2014that\u2019s \nnot\n the meaning we give it.\n \nWe then start mixing it up, with this mythical \nfeeling \nthat will be able to generate the energy required for us to behave in a particular way.\n \nWe tend to also treat it as a prerequisite; as if this feeling has to be present before we do a given thing.\n \n\u201cI\u2019m not motivated today.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhen am I going to be motivated again?\u201d\n \n\u201cI need some motivation before I start.\u201d\n \nNotice however, that nowhere in the first definition does it say that one has to \nfeel\n motivation. It only speaks of the desire driving action. If I told you Usain Bolt was motivated to train for the Olympics, that only means he has a goal he values in his sights\u2014not that every moment of his experience is filled with feelings of motivation. Point being, that \nthese two definitions of motivation are not the same thing.\n \nAnd that is a \nvery\n good thing.\nContrary to how we treat them, feelings aren\u2019t instructions we should follow, sent from the deep, all-knowing core inside of us.\n \nThere is at least no evidence of that.\n \nThe unsexy, best guess of a truth we currently have is that\n feelings are our brains best interpretations of outward stimuli \nbased on our personal biology, history, personality, expectations and culture.\n[1]\n \n[2]\n \n[3]\n \n[4]\n \nAlso, as the high-school version of me would tell you: feelings are fickle beasts.\n \nNot constant, but fluctuating.\n \nNot rational, but irrational.\n \nNo one feels pulsating motivation \nall the time,\n just like no one feels constant anger, happiness or joy.\n \nDoing something you\u2019re not used to doing, it\u2019s in fact very likely you\u2019ll not \nfeel\n much motivation\u2014at least at first. Rarely do we like doing that we\u2019re bad at.\n \nSo \n\u201cmotivation the feeling\u201d\n shouldn\u2019t matter.\n \nWhat should is the \noverarching desire\n that drives our actions, even\u2014and perhaps especially\u2014when we don\u2019t particularly feel like performing those actions.\n \nWhat drives people to train everyday and what we need isn\u2019t \nmotivation\n, but \ndedication\n.\n \nDedication, to a goal we\u2019ve set ourselves.\n \nDedication, to being who we want to be.\n \nDedication, to what \nmotivates us\n.\n \nNo one wants to eat vegetables, drag themselves to the gym and go to bed early. These are not sexy, fun or appealing things to do. The only reason why some do them is because they\u2019re dedicated to an overarching goal, desire or way of life they value.\n \nBut is doing whatever you want to do going to be a constant uphill battle? Are you never going to like it?\n \nThe good news is that\u2019s highly unlikely.\n \nIf you\u2019re anything like most people, you\u2019ll enjoy it more and more the more time you spend doing it.\n \nAs stated, we like doing things we\u2019re good at and we become good at that which we do. It\u2019s a \npositive feedback loop.\nOne action spurs another, which again spurs the original action.\n \nFurthermore, we mostly don\u2019t operate based on momentary desire. Virtually no one contemplates how they feel about brushing their teeth or weighs the pros and cons of cutting their nails.\n \nDoing so would be exhausting and extremely inefficient.\n \nMost of our decisions are made blindly, out of habit. That which we do everyday is treated just as things to be done. Exercise becomes very much the same way.\n \nIt\u2019s also important to notice how motivation and dedication are not on opposite sides of the spectrum. One does not take away from the other. In fact, they\u2019re symbiotic, feeding off of each other.\n \nThe stronger your motivation\u2014being the \nthing\n, the \ngoal\n, the \ndesire\n that motivates you\u2014the easier it is to dedicate yourself to it. The more you\u2019re able to dedicate yourself to something, the more motivated you\u2019ll feel, because you\u2019re now accomplishing what motivates you, and few things are more motivating than sensing progress towards a goal we value.\n \nMost often, it works like this in practice:\nFind something that motivates you.\n As we\u2019ve gone over, this doesn\u2019t mean something you\u2019ll enjoy doing 100% of the time, but simply something that\u2019ll make you happy/successful in the long run.\nDedicate yourself to it.\n You\u2019ll inevitably, for a moment or 100, not want to do it. Do it anyway.\nDo it for a long enough time that it becomes ingrained. \nYou\u2019ll have to fight less and less to do it. Some days, you\u2019ll still have to though. That\u2019s life.\nToo many people accept blindly the idea that they need to feel motivated to do something. That which we decide as true shape our vision of the world.\n \nIf reaching your goal is something that\u2019s important to you, I strongly recommend leaving that crowd and the idea that feelings of motivation are a prerequisite for action behind.\n \nDon\u2019t depend on a fleeting feeling. Depend on what will make you happiest in the long run.\n \nMotivation will come and go.\n \nIt rises, like the ocean, then it sinks again.\n \nAnd you\u2019ll be there. Still going strong. Still working.\n \nWith it.\n \nWithout it.\nTo answer your question directly: No one feels motivated to workout every day. People simply do so because of their habits, environment and identity. If you want to be more consistent in the gym, those are the things you should aim to change, not your feelings of motivation.\nFootnotes\n[1] \nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/feeling-our-emotions/\n[2] \nWhy Your Biology Runs on Feelings - Issue 56: Perspective - Nautilus\n[3] \nhttps://humdev.uchicago.edu/sites/humdev.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shweder/2008--The%20Cultural%20Psychology%20of%20the%20Emotions%20-%20Ancient%20and%20Renewed.PDF\n[4] \nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.577.4057&rep=rep1&type=pdf"

You could set experience \novertraining syndrome\n, where your body cannot recover enough between workouts.\n \nAdditionally, your body requires a certain amount of time to recover between workouts. If you\u2019re providing enough stimulus to your muscles this is usually between 36 and 48 hours (\ndepending on the muscle worked (muscles like your core tend to recover faster\n), your gender (\nwomen tend to recover faster than men)\n, the intensity that you worked the muscle (\nthe harder you worked it the longer it will take)\n, your age (\nover 60 you will require as much as 96 hours rest to recover between workouts), \nthe nutrition applied, and your hormone profile (\nmore testosterone, HGH, IGF will lead to quicker recovery when coupled with adequate amounts of protein and glucose\n)).\nIf you don\u2019t give it enough time, you won\u2019t build up past your initial baseline, and your muscles will suffer.\n \nAs metabolic fatigue builds up, even in lighter intensity training, you\u2019ll feel it all over. It could be something simple at first \u2014 you stop improving in your lifts, for example. Eventually you start getting worse. Soon you start getting injuries that aren\u2019t healing. You start to feel depressed. Even one day off with complete relaxation or even a light walk could be enough to clear you out, if you catch it early enough. Serious cases of overtraining could require more time.\n \nTo re-iterate:\nIf you don\u2019t work it over 80% intensity every day\nIf you \ndo\n take a break once every 1\u20132 weeks\nYou\u2019ll be fine.\n \nIf you notice things going wrong \u2014 you start feeling weaker, you stop improving, you start feeling like crap in general, you start getting injuries\u2026take a step back. Rest. Recover.\nBrief anecdote as illustration\n \nOnce I was really working my pull ups. I was stuck at 18. I would do them daily, at least 4 sets. I hit 18 every time in my first set, I ended up doing about 50 a day. At first I was gaining daily, I went from 8 to 10 to 14, to 18\u2026but then the growth stopped. I was stuck there for a couple weeks.\n \nI took 2 days off from doing pull ups.\n \nThe next time I stepped up to the bar I did 25 in my first set.\n \nI\u2019m not saying that you\u2019ll have dramatic results like this, but sometimes the missing part of your workout is actually \nnot\n working out."

And it\u2019s only after the muscle recovers, does it begin to adapt and grow in size and strength.\n \nIf you perform heavy leg workouts every day, you deny the muscles a chance to recover. And when you deny recovery, you also deny the legs the potential to grow bigger. This is called overtraining.\n \nThe generally recommended rest period is 24 to 48 hours per muscle between workouts. I know when I used to be a powerlifter, and was squatting between 600 and 700 lbs drug-free, because of the heavy weights involved, There would be weeks when I needed a full week to recover.\n \nFor the average beginner, working your legs every day with heavy weights will likely result in overtraining. And this would be counterproductive to making strength and muscle gains."

I can afford to go for 4 days at max, no matter how much I love working out, I understand that prioritizing gym before my work is not a good option for me, personally. This is why I try to cover my entire body during those 4 days.\nAt first, I struggled to find a workout split that would help me do all workouts in 4 days, but then I saw the push pull legs workout. I started following that, and the results were amazing. I even researched the whole mixed workout thing, and I understood that doing a mixed workout every day is better than the typical bro split, at least for me. You can easily target different muscles of your body and can focus more on compound lifts. These lifts help you burn more calories, build more muscle, and improve your strengths. Compound lifts also help you raise your testosterone levels, which is another advantage.\n \nNot only does it saves time, but it also helps you target each muscle group in a short period of time. I have been following the mixed workout split for almost 3 years now, and I do not feel like going back to the same old bro split, as my body feels way better working out like this."

Today, there are just as many frustrated lifters as there were 20 years ago, when gym rats spent 20 hours per week or more in their local box.\n \nMost\n bodybuilders hit plateaus, no matter how often they lift, because they don't want to change their routine\u2014comfort quickly leads to fewer gains.\n \nUsing an old pre-season football strategy of two-a-day workouts\u2014literally lifting twice in one day\u2014is a great way to mix up your routine, giving you better muscle and strength gains while helping to slash body fat.\n \nAnd no, you don't have to be in the NFL to do two-a-days!\n \nThis approach is great for anybody looking to make awesome gains on a tight schedule because, as it turns out, two 30-minute workouts are actually more productive than one 60-minute workout.\n \nAdvantages Of Two-A-Days\n \nOne of the greatest benefits of doing two-a-days lies in the obvious\u2014you're working out twice in one day and, hopefully, you're also eating two post - workout meals!\n \nBy working out twice, you get your protein synthesis and other anabolic systems racing. If you take full advantage of this by having two post-workout meals, you can start to see your gains skyrocket.\n \nYou will also find yourself able to train with more intensity.\n \nWhen faced with a full hour's worth of exercise, most of us subconsciously conserve our energy early on, so we don't find ourselves dragging through the latter portion of the workout. By splitting the total day's training between two sessions, intensity levels start and finish higher, which is key to new strength and muscle gains!\n \nAnd since you're fully ramped up for each workout, you'll burn more total calories than if the whole workout had been done at the same time.\n \nThe greater calorie deficit will offset the extra food being eaten, and the overall affect is more muscle with more fat burn\n \nHow To Do Two-A-Day Workouts\n \nTwo-A-Day Basics\n \nSome basic rules apply to all two-a-day programs.\n \nWhile you don't have to be exact with the timing, you need to allow at least six hours between the two workouts. If your workouts are much closer than this, you'll be too tired for optimal performance during round two.\n \nBecause of this, most people find it easiest to hit the gym in the morning before work and then catch another session after work. Going on your lunch break and then again in the evening also works well, as long as you've waited at least six hours.\n \nYou also have to make sure you limit your workouts to no more than 40 minutes in length, excluding the warm-up.\n \nAnd yes, it is very important for you to perform a proper warm-up and cool-down to speed up recovery, since you'll be back in the gym before the day is over!\n \nThe light, rhythmic exercise you get with a proper cool-down, such as 5-10 minutes of an easy aerobic activity like running, will help the heart to return the pooled blood trapped in the pumped-up muscles, speed up the removal of lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, and allow the muscles to lengthen again after the chronic contractions of a good lifting session.\n \nYou'll quickly get tired of two-a-days if you're constantly fatigued, so a quick and efficient recovery is the key to this program's success.\n \nTwo-A-Days Should Be Cycled\n \nSimply doing two random workouts in one day will quickly lead to overtraining and burnout. There's a proper way to structure your program so that you meet the increased energy demands and take full advantage of this unique fat-burning and muscle-building opportunity.\n \nDue to the intensity of training, these programs are best saved for busting through plateaus, or for those times when you're extremely motivated to work out and the idea of going to the gym that much sounds appealing.\n \nTo avoid overtraining, two-a-days should be cycled\u2014two weeks on, one week off\u2014or you'll burn out and, alas, plateau\u2014the very thing you'd hoped to overcome.\n \nTreat the two-a-day regime with respect, and it will respect you back!\n \nDesigning A Two-A-Day Program\n \nWhile there are plenty of ways to design your program, one of the most effective is lifting heavy in the first workout, then lighter in the second.\n \nThis lets you train your high-threshold muscle fibers\u2014the ones with the most strength and growth potential\u2014with a short, tough workout in the morning, while fitting in an evening workout that's easier but longer."

And it could also include \n10 minutes or so of aerobic exercise\n following your weight lifting - the stair climber, rowing machine, stationary bike or stepper machine - to be done AFTER your weight lifting workout.\n \nThis timeline does not include any stretching, dynamic or static. \nIf you\u2019re somebody who insists on stretching at the outset, then do only \ndynamic\n stretching. \nStatic\n stretching should only be done after the workout and ONLY for the muscles you worked on that day - no pain should be involved. You will have stretched your muscles on the gym floor anyway because lengthening and shortening a muscle is what movement is all about! Personally I NEVER stretch and certainly never with static stuff.\n \nExercise 4\u20136 days weekly and never over-train your muscles.\n That would mean that if you train your chest on one day, you would rest at least one day before doing the chest again - that allows those muscle to be repaired and rebuilt and to get stronger. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you can\u2019t exercise the day after your chest workout, just that it should involve another muscle group.\n \nYou can google tons of suggestions on this but an example with a 5-day schedule might be the following:\n \nDay 1 = quads, calves\n \nDay 2 = chest, triceps, anterior delts\n \nDay 3 = back, traps, abs\n \nDay 4 = hamstrings, calves\n \nDay 5 = chest, biceps, forearms\n \nFor more free tips and suggestions on diet and exercise, check out my videos on Instagram or YouTube.\n \nIG = \ncalorieburningat72\n \nYT = \nare you fat making or calorie burning?\n (same title as my upcoming book, Fall 2020)"

I have tried both and I found both to be effective.\n \nEven today, most of my workout is focused on the morning where I put in an average of 45 min to an hour. Some days, I get a window to go for walks or do short sprints in the evening and I go for it.\n \nWhat really matters here is consistency. Do you have the time and discipline to do 2 sessions of 30 min in a day? Then go for it.

Or use your watch to stop the time (you\u2019ll try to beat the time you recorded).\n \nAs soon as you hit \u201cstart\u201d and the clock is ticking, you\u2019ll perform 200 push-ups, 250 squats and 100 towell pullups as fast as possible (with excellent form, obviously).\n \nOf course you shouldn\u2019t bang out all 200 push-ups, 250 squats and 100 pullups all in one set!\n \nDivide the work up, so that you DON\u2019T go to muscular failure on each and every set! That\u2019s really important, or else you\u2019ll burn out.\n \nWhat I do, for example, is that I do sets of 20 on push-up (so 10 sets per \u201cround\u201d), 25\u201350 reps on squats, 5\u201310 reps on pullups.\n \nFind a set and rep scheme that works for you. Again, you SHOULD NOT go to muscular failure in each and ever set. Keep 2\u20133 reps in the tank.\n \nWith that said, the key do these type of workouts, is to rest as little as possible (remember you\u2019re doing this for time).\n \nI always hit a set of push-ups, immediately followed by a set of squats and then, without rest, I bang out my pullups. Then I\u2019ll rest for 45\u201360sec. Only to start the next set.\n \nTrust me, your heart rate will jack the heck up on this routine!\n \nYou don\u2019t have to run any additional cardio with this and you\u2019ll develop a very \u201cfunctional\u201d type of strength endurance if you stick to it.\n \nOh, and you\u2019ll also build some lean muscle! Especially if you haven\u2019t used these type of \u201cprison cell workouts\u201d in the past.\n \nBut make no mistake\u2026This is not for the faint of heart.\n \nIf you need help with this routine, then shoot me a DM or comment down below!\n \nAll the best and I\u2019m rooting for you,\n \nMattis Rogers"

Cardiovascular exercise: Include some form of cardio to improve your cardiovascular fitness and burn calories. You can choose activities like jogging or running in place, jumping rope, high knees, or dancing. Perform cardio exercises for 20-30 minutes, aiming for moderate to high intensity.\n \n4. Core exercises: Strengthen your core with exercises like planks, mountain climbers, Russian twists, and bicycle crunches. Include 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise.\n \n5. Flexibility work: Finish your routine with some stretching exercises to improve flexibility and prevent muscle tightness. Focus on stretches for major muscle groups, including your legs, hips, back, shoulders, and chest. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds.\n \n6. Rest and recovery: Allow your body time to rest and recover between workout sessions. Aim for at least one day of rest per week to prevent overtraining and promote muscle growth.\n \nRemember, it's important to start with exercises that match your current fitness level and gradually increase intensity and resistance as you get stronger. Additionally, consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions."

Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent. Extend your legs back so you are balanced on your hands and toes, your feet hip-width apart. Once in this position, here is how you will do a push-up.\nContract your abs and tighten your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine.\nInhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself to the floor, until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.\nExhale while contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands, returning to the start position.\n2. Glute Bridge\n \nA glute bridge is an exercise that can be used to target the gluteal muscles. It is often seen in warm up segments or strength/accessory training segments to increase glute activation, strength, and muscle hypertrophy.\n \nHow To Do It:\nLie face up on the floor, with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Keep your arms at your side with your palms down.\nLift your hips off the ground until your knees, hips and shoulders form a straight line. Squeeze those glutes hard and keep your abs drawn in so you don\u2019t overextend your back during the exercise.\nHold your bridged position for a couple of seconds before easing back down.\n3. Toe-touch\n \nStrengthen your abdominal muscles with an exercise that combines the toe touch and the crunch and is sometimes referred to as the toe-touch crunch, or the vertical toe touch.The toe touching ab exercise primarily trains your rectus abdominis -- the muscle that makes up your six-pack. Your core, however, includes your side obliques, transverse abdominis, back stabilizers and pelvic floor.\n \nHow To Do It:\nLie on your back with your palms down by your sides. Bend your knees and bring them toward your torso, then slowly start to straighten your legs. They should ultimately end up perpendicular to the ground.\nLift your arms. While exhaling, slowly roll your shoulders up off the mat, reaching towards your toes. Round your shoulders forward (but keep them down) to create a concave shape with your torso. Your lower back should stay on the ground, but don\u2019t press it into the floor \u2014 that\u2019ll flatten the natural curve of your lower back and take you out of the correct position.\nInhale as you lower back down. When you reach the ground, keep the tension in your abs firing. In other words, don\u2019t just relax on the mat. That's one rep.\nThis video that I watched has really helped me out and goes indebt"

Then you just have to do the push, which will be hard, but give it 100% and then stop and reset as needed.\n \nNext, bodyweight squats. Sit on a kitchen chair, or the toilet, or a comfortable chair if you really want to. Without using your arms, lean forward and stand up. Once you are fully upright, sit back down again but do not let your weight sink into the chair - just sit down until you feel contact between your body and the material of the seat. Now stand up again. Remember, no hands! Also, your feet should not move at all. Repeat for 10 reps per set, 3 sets.\n \nLunges - from a standing position, take a step forward with one foot. Drive your front knee forward and bend it, until your hip is as close to the heel of your front foot as you can manage, ideally with your rear leg being straight. Now move back up to your starting position and repeat the motion with the other leg.

Super affordable and a great resource that I use until today.\n \nIf you\u2019re trying to bulk up and put on muscle fast, invest in Creatine Monohydrate, and then probably Whey Protein (I prefer concentrate as it has more immunological benefits, but if your sensitive to milk, try Isolate). If you\u2019re trying to put on size, you need to be eating 1g to 1.5 g of protein/per lb of bodyweight (example: 100lb male needs to ingest 100g-150g of protein/daily). I\u2019d try eating 30gr of protein immediately within 30 minutes of waking up (see Tim Ferriss\u2019s 4 hour Body book for more info regarding that.\n \nAlso just challenge yourself in new ways. Try gymnastic moves like handstands, try perfecting a perfect 15 second handstand hold. Or construct your own parrallete bars out of PVC pipes, and practice doing an L-sit hold. These isometric types of exercises are great for the home gym lifter, and will tax you in a ways you\u2019re not used to. Something that is severely overlooked in weightlifting is grip strength. A great thing to do so simple, but would be just hanging for a pull-up bar as long as you could. Improved grip strength will improve all your other lifts such as pull-ups, dips, etc."

Set a Schedule\n \nFirst, create your weekly schedule. This is so important for carving out time for fitness. Aim to schedule at least 40 minutes a day for your workout from home routine. You can cut it up into 15-minute intervals. Take one day off a week or alternate your workout between an at-home stretching routine and a daily at-home fitness routine.\n \nOne tip to sticking with your at-home workout routine is to prepare for it just like you would if you\u2019re headed to a gym. Put your workout clothes shoes and water bottle all right next to your home office space. Consider even wearing your workout clothes while you work. That way you\u2019ll have fewer excuses to carve out the time for an at-home workout.\n3. The Best Free Resources for Working Out from Home\n \nRight now there are countless free workout routines available for you to stream from anywhere. Check with your regular gym, or use my free YouTube videos. If you are hypermobile, check out our Spoonie Resources page too for links to many Hypermobility specialists.\n \n4. Create Your Own Workout\n \nTake some time to engage your mind and get creative with your workout from home routine. Create your own workout routine with these easy steps:\n \nPick 9 exercises in a row that use equipment you have in your home. If you don\u2019t have any equipment, pick bodyweight exercises.\n \nPick an exercise for your upper body core and lower body. Three of each works nicely\n \nDo 8 to 12 reps of each and move on to the next one with just a 10-second break. Work your way through the list 3 to 5 times.\n \nRepeat 3 times a week.\n \n5. Go for a Daily Walk or Jog\n \nGetting outside is extremely important while you\u2019re limited to leaving your house. Find time to go for a daily walk or jog. If you\u2019re walking, bring 1 to 2-pound hand weights with you avoid using ankle weights, which cause unnecessary strain on your knees and hips. Do speed intervals by speed walking or lightly jogging for one minute then at a normal pace for 2 to 3 minutes.\n \nIf you\u2019re a jogger do the same thing, except don\u2019t choke the weights. Hold them as loosely as possible in your hand.\n6. Get Creative\n \nKeep your workouts fresh by switching up your routine. Change your walking route mix and match exercises and use an app once a week. Find a unique blend of different exercises that works for you. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment a little bit here. Try working out during different times of the day or opt to try a new way of exercising. Take advantage of the freedom you have to set your schedule from home and make the most out of a less-than-ideal situation.\n \n7. Go for HSD/EDS Safe Exercise Apps\n \nRight now there are a lot of fitness apps that are offering at-home workout routines for free. But most of these are not safe for hypermobile persons. These apps are specifically designed to have safer exercises for persons with unstable bodies. A few of my favorites are:\n \nThe Zebra Club - by Jeanie Di Bon\n \nPhysioEd\n8. Split Everything into Small Breaks\n \nIf you're juggling kids at home a spouse who\u2019s got a lot of conference calls and a million tasks piling up with your work and life we hear you. Seriously. This is A LOT to take on at the moment and exercising at home might be the last thing on your mind especially when you\u2019re low on spoons. There are certainly ways to carve out time for a workout from home routine.\n \nInstead of trying to get a 30-minute block in, split it up into smaller intervals. Do a work task and then take 3 minutes for a single exercise. If you use this method, use a low-load with little to no extra weight. Without being warmed up it\u2019s unsafe to add weights to your exercise.\n \n9. Take Your At-Home Workout Outdoors\n \nOne way to make your workout from home routine successful is to move your workout outdoors. If you have an outdoor space set up your laptop or phone outdoors for a workout full of Vitamin D. This is a great way to not only work out from home but boost your immunity too. Sunshine boosts your mood and the fresh air is good for your soul. Not to mention that Vitamin D3 is vital for a healthy immune system."

This is the most basic requirement.\n \nThe next is to improve your cardiovascular capacity. The result will be you are working at a lower heart rate than before. Less stress on the heart.\n \nThen you should also work on agility and balance. This will regain back the spring in your step as you grow old and move around flat footed. You are also less likely to fall and hurt yourself.\n \nThe two main muscle groups used daily are the lower body and the upper body pulling action.

This is the most basic requirement.\n \nThe next is to improve your cardiovascular capacity. The result will be you are working at a lower heart rate than before. Less stress on the heart.\n \nThen you should also work on agility and balance. This will regain back the spring in your step as you grow old and move around flat footed. You are also less likely to fall and hurt yourself.\n \nThe two main muscle groups used daily are the lower body and the upper body pulling action. The third group is the upper body pushing action. Very seldom used but you can also do the workout if you want to.\n \nForget all the various types of workouts you can do. Just stick to the simplest that you can groove in and do in your sleep.\n \nThe body weight squat is sufficient for the lower body strength. There is also the need to increase stair climbing ability and endurance. A low stool is a good point to start. Then onto a sturdy chair as you improve. Do this in conjunction with the body squat. It prepares the body when you switch from walking and then climbing stairs.\n \nLower back extensions will cover the upper body pulling action. The most basic is bending forward while trying to touch the toes and then straightening up. It sounds simple but it is NOT. The SPINE must be kept in the neutral position ALL the time. It forces the lower back muscles to do most of the work and thus you will get the proper adaptation. A more advanced and more strength adaptation workout is in the image below.\nPull ups will build arm and related muscles.\n \nPush ups are enough for the pushing group of muscles.\n \nThe agility, balance and cardiovascular part is taken care of by doing rope skipping or rope jumping, whatever the term. For the average person, it is equivalent to running for the same length of time in terms of energy usage if you are looking at weight loss as well.\n \nThe only problem you will face is that it is NOT easy at first. If you target say 30 minutes, I doubt you can even do the two leg version for 10 minutes. Your legs will start to burn. That is the alert to stop. Just do the one leg after the other version at slow speed. Stop and rest when you are alerted. Then continue until you reach the 30 minutes. As you improve, increase speed and slowly build up until you can do the two leg version continously for your target duration. Rope skipping, especially on two legs involve the toes, the ankles and calves mainly. The thigh muscle do only a bit of work. Hardly any stress on the knees as the angle of bend is small. So no fear of knee injury.\n \nNot much more to add except to point out a few things. The rope skipping will most probably bring you up to around 80% of max. This is because you are working at just below the leg burning stage. That level is enough for a fairly high level of cardiovascular adaptation if done for a long enough duration and period. How you schedule your workouts and whether to mix them together in a single session, I leave to you."

Get your blood pumping with some jogging in place or high knees. Swing those arms and legs, twist your torso gently, and throw in some jumping jacks for good measure.\n \nNow, let's tackle the upper body. Push-ups are your best friend here; aim for 3 sets of 10-15 reps. Need something for those triceps? Grab a chair or use an elevated surface for tricep dips, doing 3 sets of 10-15 reps. Don't forget about your core \u2013 plank variations like the standard plank, side plank, and plank with shoulder taps are excellent choices (hold each for 30-60 seconds).\n \nTime to work those legs! Body-weight squats are fantastic; aim for 3 sets of 15-20 reps. Throw in some lunges (forward or reverse) with 3 sets of 10 reps for each leg. Want to activate those glutes? Try glute bridges or hip thrusts, doing 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n \nLet's give some love to your core muscles. Bicycle crunches (3 sets of 15-20 reps each side) and Russian twists (3 sets of 15-20 reps each side) are great picks. Finish off with leg raises or flutter kicks for 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n \nFeeling energetic? Add some cardio or high-intensity moves like jump squats, burpees (3 sets of 8-10 reps), and mountain climbers (3 sets of 30-45 seconds).\n \nFinally, cool down with a slow jog or walk in place. Stretch out those muscles with gentle stretches for your hamstrings, quads, calves, chest, back, and shoulders.\n \nRemember, listen to your body, take breaks when needed, and stay hydrated throughout your workout!"

Make sure to think about what body parts you want to focus on for example (abs) you\u2019d be doing planks/crunches etc. Dedicate a space where you want to get in shape and listen to something you enjoy to keep you motivated. Create goals for yourself and have good strategies to work your way in achieving it, consistently taking small steps will build up and hopefully you will get in shape! Good luck!"

Simple, easy lifting, I don\u2019t know how much the weight is but I am just 13, so it\u2019s not so much. I lift for 30 mins - 1 hr. Then I take my dog for a walk, after walking my dog, I put her back inside and go to jog. First several seconds I brisk walk, then I walk a bit faster, after, once I\u2019ve reached the end of the sidewalk, where I must turn right to continue onto the sidewalk, I start to jog, once I\u2019ve crossed another patch of the roads, I start to run, then jog, then brisk walk, then just walk. Sometimes I try and run the whole way, but it usually doesn't work.\n \nAfter that, I head back inside, by the time I\u2019m back, it\u2019s usually late (around 7:40 or 8:15 pm), still, I continue to exercise, Russian twists, jumping jacks, squats, push-ups (modified), stretching, etc\u2026\n \nIt feels nice to use the energy I have after school instead of sitting around and playing video games until 12 am, that\u2019s what I used to do, but once I realized just how important my health is, I started working out. You can use this schedule too, but if you don\u2019t have dumbbells/weights, I recommend using filled milk cartons or something heavy which you can grasp and lift. I am also thinking about getting a gym membership and a gym nearby, so maybe get one of those, they cost money but it\u2019s worth it."

I think the movie Holes showed this to some extent. Anyway, as the ox got heavier, the man carried it. Eventually when the ox was a big mature ox, the man had very big muscles and could lift an ox. Which weighs a few hundred pounds. He went from carrying a baby ox to something huge. \n \nThis story is a simplified example of the principle of overload, specificity, and profession. \n \nTo grow muscles you need to overload them. To an extent. Small micro tears from training will stimulate new repairs and extra bulk be added to the muscle fibers. So if you had to carry or life a 50 pound object everyday, at first it will be hard, eventually it would get easier until it'll be no effort at all.  But eventually the body will adapt to the point where you need to add more weight if you want to get stronger or bigger. \n \nThat's the principle of overload and profession. \n \nThe principle of specificity basically says, if you want to get good at running, run more. Specify in what you want to achieve in. If you want to be able to life more weight, life more weight. If you want to be a good mountain climber, climb more mountains etc.\n \nSo there you have it. To get stronger you need to do more. Stress the body more. \n \nLook into nutrition. Much of \"reaping the benefits\" of training occur in the kitchen. Consume healthy fats and proteins. Limit carbs but keep in mind that carbs are needed for insulin which help stimulate muscle growth. \n \nAlso if you ever do get back into the gym. \n1-5 reps = strength 7-10 = mass 11+ = endurance \n \nAs for now, purchase some body weights and train with those. Doing pull-ups with an extra twenty pound weight on your chest is hard! Good luck."

It isn't as tiring or grueling on your joints as it is when you're doing runs on varied, uneven, and realistic terrain.\n \nI liked going to the gym and rotating between lifting machines like the bicep curl, tricep press, and tricep pushdown when I wanted to blow off steam; but the muscle soreness and stiffness that I got in the inboard side of my elbow (known as the medial epicondyle) was excruciating every time I tried to straighten my arm a day after the workout.\n \nAs a result, I'd have to go to work the next day with my arms squared off in a stiff, rigid, and 45-degree angle. My arms being bent at the elbow and unable to extend without causing agony. People thought I was playing around, \u201cLook at this dick walking around trying to make chicken sandwiches with his robot arms.\u201d\n \nSo cardio became my go to. Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December, and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n \n(Upvote for the Edgar Allan Poe reference? )\n \nI went to exercise at L.A Fitness with a gym rat who practically snorted canisters of preworkout and whey protein. And he had a free guest pass, so I said what the hell. I got the heart, kid! I was always at the disadvantage, but I doggedly followed his workout routine despite feeling I was over training my muscles.\n \nThe days that we were too worn out or didn't have enough time to go through with a full workout, we treated them as cardio days. Immediately, I fell in love with the treadmill.\n \nThe way Mr.Protein saw it, it was either go home with your mind carrying your agonized and hypertrophic corpse in a body bag, or do cardio until you dropped.\n \nSo I grew fond of working to a beat, treading on the elastic band that bounced with a slight resistance as it looped under my feet, and seeing the gorgeous female triathletes who seemed to have unparalleled stamina run alongside me.\n \nI'd start off getting started at a slow and steady 3.5 MPH and would gradually increase the speed by .2 every minute. Often, I'd swap my playlist to an upbeat and fast BPM playlist to challange myself to what I deemed a speed round.\n \nRaised the incline, raised the speed to 6.0 MPH, and raised the resistance. And every twenty seconds, I'd increase the speed by .20\n \nBefore all this, I was always confused as to why people enjoyed running track or doing seemingly linear sports ike cross-country. But then I tried it for myself in the comfort of a warm gym. It feels like you're running away from it all. Not in a bad way. It feels a bit like you're the last mazerunner burdened with dashing through the labrynth-complex that is life.\n \nThere's a controlled rhythm and willpower, and most of the time you'll be too focused on keeping your lungs supplied with oxygen for you to think about much else. It's a fascinating workout all-in-all.\n \nCheers,\n \nDaniel.\n \nSources :\n \nGolfer's elbow - Symptoms and causes"

Depending on my fitness level, exercise could be as simple as taking a short walk to increase my heart rate and blood flow.\n \nI don't need an intense workout such as heavy weightlifting or high-intensity interval training (HIIT).\nHow I exercise depends on my health goals. For example, if I want to lose fat and gain muscle, I will focus on heavy compound movements. In addition, my diet is extremely critical.\n \nTo keep myself motivated, I measure my results. Furthermore, I don't compare myself to others because everyone\u2019s body is different. Every person has his or her unique different genetics, health, and fitness history. The only person I compare to is my former self.\n \nI focus on my progress.\n \nPersistence and consistency are the two key factors for achieving my goals.\n \nBreak Through Your Plateau\n \nAfter reaching a certain fitness level, your body will stagnate because it has adapted to those changes. This is great if your goal is to maintain. But if you want to break through the plateau, your body must experience a higher intensity or resistance.\n \nThis is when progressive overload applies.\n \nTo get stronger and have more muscle for a particular body part, your body must experience a higher amount of resistance.\n \nFor example, if you can lift 125 pounds for your barbell military press for 4 to 6 reps and you want more strength and muscles in your shoulders, you must increase the weights during your workouts. Along with proper macronutrients fueling and rest, you will gain more strength and shoulder definition over time.\nBut the process could take longer if you want to increase muscle and strength while minimizing fat. To do so, you can first bulk to gain fat and muscle. Afterward, you can cut to maintain muscle while losing fat.\n \nHowever, if you're new to weightlifting, you can quickly build muscle while losing fat.\n \nFocus on Exercises which Excite You\n \nIf your goal is to maintain optimal health, then performing enjoyable exercises will be your most desirable and sustainable approach. That's because you're more likely to exercise if you look forward to them. Such options might be a dance class, morning group hike, or a run with your dog.\n \nFor example, one of my personal favorite hobbies is rock-climbing.\nAlthough it's challenging, I look forward to going to the rock-climbing gym because I find it extremely fun and engaging. It's both physically and mentally difficult because I have many ways of finishing the problem.\n \nWorking out with a partner can make your exercise session even more enjoyable, not to also mention accountability - you both don't want to let the other person down. In addition to improving your health, you get to spend quality time with them which further deepends your relationship.\n \nProducing many health benefits, exercise is an excellent way to release endorphins, ..."

I hated running in middle and high school (anything before, I probably enjoyed, but don't remember much), mostly because it was forced upon me by the school administration in the form of pacers and the infamous 1 mile runs. \n \nOnce college hit and I began to realize that my health is actually on my shoulders, I ventured into the world of yoga, mainly because it doesn't involve any kind of traditional cardio (i.e. running). I never tried bikram, but hard-core classes like power yoga or advanced vinyasa flow made you sweat and toned and super freakishly flexible. I began jogging when I realized that my heart rate wasn't going as fast as when I first started, and weirdly enough it didn't feel like a work-out without breathing hard. \n \nThe first time I ran more than 2 miles was mind-boggling. And then I ran a 5k (on my own, not in a race and rather slowly), I literally thought I was dreaming and pinched myself. Compared to other avid runners, I'm quite slow, I average probably 10min/mile to 12min/mile depending on the day, but each time I hit another distance (like 5 miles, etc) or time goals (like 5k in 30min, etc), it hooked me. Of course I have days where I absolutely loath putting my running shoes, so I substitute yoga. \n \nOne thing that I have noticed with running more often for longer times and distances is that you can get extremely tight quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, gastrocnemius, essentially all your leg muscles and your abs. So I'm not as stretchy and yoga is actually a bit more painful (I appreciate wooden people's yoga feats more now), which in turn led me to more running. So lots of stretching and sprinkling of yoga along with some healthy goals and good running shoes resulted in this weird love for running. :)"

But meat and veggies os the way to balance your hormones and lose the fat.\n \nAs for training.. if youve never lifted before i URGE you to hire a trainer. You don't have to work out with a trainer for ever but it is important to learn proper form and technique learn what exercises work what muscle groups and Lauren how hard to push yourself how long to wait between exercises order of exercises excetera excetera. Doing research is great but as I'm sure you have noticed for every answer you find you will find someone who says the opposite. Without a professional guiding you often times it's hard to know what advice to take comma granted not all \u201cexpert\u201d advice in the health and field industry is really expert LOL. And not all trainers are created equal. You want someone with at least a year experience ask them about their previous clients and their success stories ask them about their methods and protocols and the reason why they use those methods. If they can't give you concrete answers to those questions look for a different trainer.\n \nI recommend I recommend weight training 2 days a week and doing two days of interval cardio. I like weights on Monday Thursday cardio Tuesday Friday. Focus on major muscle group multi-joint compound movements. No I promise you you will not get big bulky muscles. You will get strong lean and toned. Working the big muscles using the compound exercises burns the most calories and elicit the greatest hormone response and it's the hormones that really get the job done. Lyft hard-and-fast good in work hard for about 30 minutes and go home there's no reason to lift for more than that the training is determined by effort not volume or duration. So push hard for a short time until you feel and then go do something else. Interval cardio means going as hard as you can for a short period And then resting for a short period and repeating. The routine I like is only 4 minutes you go all out maximum Sprint for 20 seconds then walk for 10 seconds and repeat eight times. That routine is clinically proven four times more effective at both muscle building and fat burning when performed twice a week with 100% maximum effort than 60 Minutes of traditional steady state cardio performed five days a week. Yes you read correctly 8 minutes is superior to 300 minutes as long as you push 100%. Good luck."

Start by choosing a muscle group like the chest. Start with weights that are lighter weight to warm up your muscles.\nIt is a good idea to do approximately 15-20 reps with the warm-up weights. The second set should involve weights for which you can complete only able to do 6-8 reps. Add five more pounds of weight and repeat the third set.\nRunning outside setting is better for you to get on a treadmill. Running on paved surfaces is better in the winter than a treadmill.\nWhen doing repetitious types of exercises that you need to count, you should count down instead of up. This keeps you an idea of just how many exercises you still have left and help keep your motivation level up.\nYou can boost your workouts by controlling your breathing properly. Try forcefully exhaling when your shoulders peak during situps. Deep breathing causes your ab muscles to work than normal.\nTest out a bench before you use it for a workout.

Swimming\nYou may call swimming the ideal workout.\n \nStudies have discovered that swimming may also enhance your mental condition and set you in a much better mood. Water Resistant is another choice.\n \n2. Tai chi\nA combination of movement and comfort is perfect for the mind and body. In reality, Tai chi is a Chinese martial art that has been known as\"meditation in movement.\" Since the courses are offered at different degrees, tai chi is available - and beneficial - for everybody and every age and fitness levels. \"It is especially great for elderly people because equilibrium is a significant part of fitness, and equilibrium is something we lose as we age,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nHave a course that will assist you to get started and find out the appropriate form. It is possible to locate tai chi apps at the regional YMCA, gym, community center, or senior center.\n \n3. Strength training\nLifting light weights will not bulk up your muscles, but it is going to keep them strong. \"If you do not use muscles, then they will lose their power over time,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nComparable to additional exercise, strength training might also help maintain brain function in later decades.\n \nBefore beginning a weight training program, make sure you learn the appropriate form. Start mild, with only a couple of lbs. You ought to be able to lift the weights 10 days easily. After a few weeks, raise this by a pound or 2. If you're able to easily lift the weights through the whole selection of movement over 12 days, then move up to marginally heavier weight.\n \n4. Walking\nWalking is easy yet secure. Additionally, it can help you keep lean, enhance cholesterol levels, fortify bones, and keep blood pressure in check, raise your mood, and decrease your risk for any range of diseases (diabetes and cardiovascular disease, by way of instance ). A variety of studies have revealed that walking and other physical actions can even enhance memory and withstand age-related memory reduction.\n \nAll you will need is a well-fitting and inviting pair of sneakers. Begin with walking for approximately 10 to15 minutes at one time. As time passes, you may begin to walk further and faster, until you are walking for 30 to 60 minutes most days of this week.\n \n5. Kegel exercises\nThese exercises will not allow you to look better. However, they do something equally as significant -- strengthen the pelvic floor muscles which support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles may go a long way toward preventing puberty. When many women are acquainted with Kegels, these exercises may benefit guys also.\n \nSqueeze the muscles you would like to stop yourself from passing gas or urine is the best way to do a Kegel exercise properly. Hold the contraction for a couple of seconds, then release. Be sure that you completely relax your pelvic floor muscles following the decrease. Attempt to perform four to five places every day.\n \nRaking the lawn counts as physical activity. So does ballroom dance and playing with your children or grandkids. Provided that you are doing some aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes each day, and you also comprise two weeks of strength training each week, you may consider yourself a \"busy\" individual."

See a doctor.\nAnytime you want to start a new training or exercise program, it'll be a smart idea to see a doctor first. He will be able to tell you whether or not your plan is safe and appropriate for you.\n \nMake an appointment or call your doctor. Tell him about what your goals are and your exercise plan to help you reach them.\n \nAlso tell him whether or not you're having any joint or muscular pain in addition to having any pain or shortness of breath.\n \nAlso consider seeing a personal trainer. This is a fitness professional that will be able to help you set goals, design a plan to meet them and teach you how to do a variety of exercises safely.\n \n2. Set your goals.\nTraining your body is a fairly broad goal. To increase your chances of meeting your goal, you should work to make a more specific goal. Try using the S.M.A.R.T. goal system. Goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Based have a higher chance of being an appropriate and reachable goal for you.\n \nIn addition, add in information about how you're going to reach your goal.\n \nSpend some time thinking about what you want to train. Do you want to just get in better overall shape? Are you training for a race? Do you want to build more strength or lean muscle? Do you want to lose some weight? How much? By when?\n \nAn example of a good goal would be: I want to run a 10 mile race in five months. I will run three to four days a week and increase my mileage by one mile every two weeks until I reach 10 miles.\n \n3. Start a journal to track your progress.\nRegardless of what you're training for or what you've set for yourself, tracking your progress in a journal may be a motivating part of your plan.\n \nWrite out your goals and your plan in your journal. This may help keep you focused and track.\n \nIn addition track your progress each day or week. If you're training for that 10 mile (16.1 km) race, maybe you write down how many miles you ran each week and how easy or hard it's been.\n \nYou can also keep a little calendar or chart of where you plan your exercise of the week or month.\n \n4. Join a gym or purchase fitness equipment.\nSome training plans may need a gym or specialized equipment to meet. Not all physical activity will need this, but you may want to consider what equipment you need to best meet your goal.\n \nConsider joining a gym. Many memberships are as low as $10 a month. Gyms offer you the ability to do most exercises inside. You can do a variety of cardio, strength training and even take classes. Even if you may not need the equipment at the gym, it might be nice to have the option to workout inside if it's a rainy or cold day.\n \nIf you're not a fan of the gym, maybe you could consider purchasing some at-home gym equipment. You can start small with just a few items like hand weights or resistance bands or buy more expensive equipment like cardio machines or home gym machines.\n \nPart 2 of 4:Training Your Body with Cardio Exercises\n1. Do 150 minutes of cardio weekly.\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend getting at least 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of cardio activities each week for the minimum amount of health benefits. This breaks down to just five 30-minute sessions a week.\n \nStudies have shown that when people participate in 150 minutes of physical activity, they see a variety of health benefits including: decreased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, weight loss, improved sleep and mood habits and even improved circulation.\n \nThe types of cardio activities that you can include for this 150 minutes can be anything from walking, running, biking, or doing a kickboxing class. However, the activity you do during the day (baseline or lifestyle activity) does not count towards your 150 minutes.\n \nIf you're just starting out with physical activity, one of your first goals may be to meet this general recommendation.\n \n2. Include both steady-state and interval training.\nThere are two main types of cardio exercises \u2014 steady-state and interval exercises. Both offer a variety of benefits, so try to incorporate both into your workout.\n \nSteady-state cardio are the activities that you do for at least 10 minutes and are maintaining your intensity. The goal is that you maintain a steady heart rate during your activity. For example, jogging for 20 minutes or using the elliptical at a steady speed for 30 minutes counts as steady-state cardio.\n \nSome of the specific benefits of steady-state cardio are: improved and faster recovery, maintenance of lean muscle mass, significant increases in cardiovascular and aerobic fitness levels, and immediate decreases in blood pressure and blood sugar.\n \nHIIT or high intensity interval training is another type of exercise that has become more popular lately. It's a shorter workout in total and combines both short bouts of very, very high intensity exercises with periods of more moderate exercises.\n \nThe benefits of HIIT differ slightly than steady-state cardio and can include: a more efficient and faster workout, increased ability to burn calories from fat and increased metabolism for eight to 24 hours after you've completed the workout.\n \nRegardless of which type of exercise you choose to do predominantly, it's better to do a combination of both HIIT and steady-state as you can reap the benefits of both.\n \n3. Increase your baseline activity.\nAlthough baseline doesn't come with as many benefits of steady-state or HIIT types of workouts, it's still an important part of being active.\n \nBaseline activity or lifestyle activities are things that you do on a typical day \u2014 walking to and from your car or doing household chores.\n \nThese activities do not burn many calories by themselves or increase your heart rate, but when you increase them as much as you can, over the entire day they do burn some calories and can help support your fitness levels.\n \nIncreasing your baseline makes your body function more efficiently in day-to-day activities (which burns more calories with less work).\n \nThink about ways that you can be more active or include more movement in your day. You could: park farther away, take the stairs instead of the elevator, take short walk breaks during your lunch break and stand or do light exercises during commercial breaks.\n \nPart 3 of 4:Training Your Body with Weight-Bearing Exercises\n1. Include two to three days of strength training weekly.\n \nIn addition to cardio, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans also recommends that you include about two to three days of strength training or weight-bearing exercises each week.\n \nStrength and resistance training offers you different benefits compared to aerobic or cardio exercises, such as: it protects bones and helps prevent osteoporosis, maintains and can increase lean muscle mass, increase your overall metabolism, improves balance and coordination, and boosts energy levels.\n \nWeight training exercises can include a variety of activities including: plyometric exercises or body weight exercises, free weights, using weight machines, or doing yoga or pilates.\n \n2. Do a combination of compound and isolation exercises.\nWhen it comes to weight lifting or resistance training there are two basic types of exercises \u2014 compound and isolation exercises. Both offer different benefits and which one you choose will depend on your overall goal.\n \nCompound exercises are activities that recruit multiple joints and multiple muscle groups in order to perform. Examples of compound exercises include: barbell bench press, squats and lunges.\n \nThe benefits of compound exercises include: reduced risk of overtraining, less time spent overall exercising, increased gains in muscle mass, and increased gains in strength.\n \nIsolation exercises are those that only target one small group of muscles or use weight machines to target only one muscle group. Examples include using the bicep curl machine or seated tricep extensions.\n \nFor most training goals (even from basic to more advanced), spending more time with compound exercises is your best bet. Isolation exercises are best for fine tweaking once you have already met your goals.\n \n3. Choose to do a low or high set of reps.\n \nIn addition to choosing compound or isolation exercises, you'll also need to decide whether or not you want to do higher reps with a low weight or lower reps with a higher weight.\n \nHigher reps usually results in bigger gains in muscle mass, not strength. If you're goal is to build mass, include exercises that have higher reps.\n \nLower reps with much higher weights results in significant strength gains, not necessarily increased muscle mass.\n \nIt's best to do a combination of both high and low rep exercises. However, tailor this depending on what you're goal is (bigger muscles or increased strength).\n \nPart 4 of 4:Training Safely\n1. Warm up.\n \nBefore any type of workout, it's essential to warm up appropriately beforehand. Try to include even a short warm up before you exercise for the safest workout.\n \nWarm-up exercises don't have to be anything specific. It's generally recommended to do a warm-up routine for at least five to 10 minutes. However, the longer you plan on working out, the longer your warm-up routine should be.\n \nThe goal of warm-ups includes: slowly dilates your blood vessels in your muscle to help increase blood and oxygen flow, raises the temperature of your muscles for the best flexibility and efficiency, and it also slowly raises your heart rate which decreases the overall stress on your heart.\n \nWarm-ups are typically a slower version of whatever activity you plan on doing. For example, if you're planning on going for a run, walk for five to 10 minutes first.\n \n2. Take a rest day or two.\nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, taking adequate rest days is just as important as the actual exercise. Without proper rest days, it'll be hard to meet any training goal.\n \nIn regards to strength training, rest days are actually when your muscles grow in size and strength.\n \nIf you do not take rest days, overtime, you will have poor performance and poor results.\n \nOn your rest days, try to still include light-intensity activity. You don't necessarily want to lounge around all day without doing anything. Ideally do some walking or restorative yoga.\n \n3. Stretch.\nA combination of adequate rest, warming up and stretching will put your body in the best condition for exercise and great results.\n \nStretching has been shown to help reduce muscle stiffness and pain when done appropriately. In addition, it can also help improve flexibility over time\n \nOther benefits of regular stretching include: better posture, increased blood flow, prevent back and neck pain, and improve balance.\n \nYou can do a slow stretching routine with moves like toe touches or you can take a restorative and stretching class like yoga."

Work the volume and intensity up as you become accustomed to working out. Many with good intentions about increasing their fitness have awakened the day after their first workout or week and don\u2019t return to their gym because of muscle soreness. Gyms rely on selling memberships to those who show up a few times and quit. If everyone that had a membership used it, most gyms couldn\u2019t handle the capacity."

        "question": "How to workout",
        "answer": "I'm going to assume you are referring to a full body, strength training workout. As a general rule, start with the largest muscle groups and work your way to the smaller. This is so you will be training the most taxing muscle groups when you are freshest. Also, if you train biceps before back for example, your arms will be too fatigued to properly work your much larger back muscles. Larger to smaller. So a full body workout will be arranged like this:\n \nLegs\n \nBack\n \nChest\n \nShoulders\n \nTriceps\n \nBiceps\n \nCore\n \nCalves\n \nHope this helps."

So even if you have all the amenities and money, the thing with fitness has always been about consistency. Working out in the morning or evening doesn\u2019t matter. Eating before or after workout doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is working out. Working out DAILY (with sufficient rest in between). So stick to a routine which you are comfortable with. A single workout plan/routine will not work for everyone. But stick to it. Be repetitive. Be CONSISTENT."

Between work, family obligations, and social commitments, where are you supposed to fit in a trip to the gym? The good news is that there are plenty of ways to get your fitness fix without leaving home or spending hours in the gym. We'll give you some tips for fitting fitness into your already busy schedule.\n \n1. What are some tips to help you fit fitness into your schedule?\n \n1. Schedule your workouts like you would any other appointment.\n \n2. Find a time that works for you and stick to it.\n \n3. Cut down on unnecessary commitments.\n \n4. Make use of technology to help you stay accountable.\n \n5. Take advantage of your surroundings.\n \n2. What are some tips to help you make time for working out if you're not a morning person?\n \nIf you're not a morning person, finding time for a workout can be tough. But don't worry, there are plenty of ways to make fitness work for you. Here are some tips to help you make time for working out:\n \n-Find a time that works for you. If you can't get to the gym in the morning, try going at night. Or, if you're really pressed for time, try doing a quick workout at home.\n \n-Schedule your workouts like you would any other appointment. This will help keep them top of mind and prevent them from getting pushed to the bottom of your to-do list.\n \n-Make use of technology. There are lots of great fitness apps and streaming services that make it easy to squeeze in a workout no matter where you are.\n \n-Get a workout buddy. Having someone to hold you accountable and push you to work harder can be a huge help when it comes to staying on track.\n \n3. What are some tips to help you make time for working out if you're not a night owl?\n \nIf you're not a night owl, don't try to work out in the evening. You'll be more likely to make excuses and skip your workout if it's scheduled for a time when you're already winding down. Instead, try to work out first thing in the morning or during your lunch break. That way, you'll have already accomplished something and you won't feel guilty about taking some time for yourself later in the day. And if you can't fit in a full workout during those times, try to at least do some quick exercises like squats or lunges. You'll be surprised at how much of a difference even a few minutes can make!\n \n4. What are some ways you can fit fitness into your schedule no matter the time of day?\n \nWhen it comes to fitting fitness into your schedule, there are no excuses. Just because you're busy doesn't mean you can't find time for a workout. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n \n- Rise and shine: Start your day with a fitness routine. Whether you do yoga, go for a run or lift some weights, getting your sweat on in the morning is a great way to set the tone for the day.\n \n- Lunch break: If you can't get away for a full workout, try squeezing in a quick fitness routine during your lunch break. A 20-30 minute walk or jog is a great way to break up the day and get your blood flowing.\n \n- Evening routine: Dedicate time at the end of the day for fitness. This could be 30 minutes of cardio or an hour-long strength training session. If you have time constraints in the evening, try mixing and matching different workouts to create a shorter routine.\n \n5. What are good ways to stay active even if you can't work out?\n \nEven if you can't always make it to the gym or go for a run, there are plenty of other ways to stay active. In fact, simply incorporating more movement into your day can help burn calories and improve your overall fitness level. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n \n1. Park your car at the far end of the lot.\n \n2. Take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator.\n \n3. Walk or ride your bike to work or school instead of driving.\n \n4. Do some squats or lunges during your commercials breaks.\n \n5. Take a brisk walk in your neighborhood after dinner.\n \n6. Use a fitness tracker to monitor your daily activity level.\n \nConclusion:\n \nWe all know how important it is to stay active and fit, but sometimes life gets in the way. With a little bit of creativity and organisation, though, you can find time to work out \u2013 no matter how busy you are. These tips will help you make time for fitness, so you can stay healthy and looking great."

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes."

However, resistance training which is often overlooked is equally needed for the maintenance of a healthy weight. As you age, the body\u2019s bone density and muscle mass deplete.

However, resistance training which is often overlooked is equally needed for the maintenance of a healthy weight. As you age, the body\u2019s bone density and muscle mass deplete. To maintain proper metabolic function, weight training is imperative! Building strong muscles means burning more calories at rest, ultimately resulting in a healthier body weight. For beginners, I recommend at least 2 days of weight training a week along with at least 3 days of cardiovascular exercise. While this may seem like too much time, you can combine the two activities! Moves like jump squats and burpee\u2019s get your heart rate up and your muscles burning!\n \n2. Change up your routine:\n \nFitness does not have to be boring! Keeping fitness fun will not only improve your adherence to exercise, but it is actually proven that changing the FITT (frequency, intensity, time, and type) of your exercise routine will yield better results. For fun workouts ideas check out my Instagram page \n@bodyby.becca.\n \n3. The \u201980-20\u2019 rule- Flexibility is Key\n \nThe \u2018All or Nothing\u2019 mindset is inherently destructive. You don\u2019t need a 1 hour workout or a perfect day of clean eating for it to \u201ccount.\u201d No one is perfect and your healthy routine won\u2019t be either! I use the \u201980-20\u2019 rule when discussing healthy lifestyle habits with clients. Meaning, 80% of the time you make consciously healthy decisions (intuitive eating and exercise) while 20% of the time strict adherence is not necessary. Just as one good meal won\u2019t make you healthy, one missed workout wont make you unhealthy! I have found this strategy to be attainable for both myself and clients; in turn, resulting in the greatest rate of long term success. Eat the ice cream once and a while, it won\u2019t kill you. Mental health is just as important as your physical health!\n \n4. Macronutrient Essentials:\n \nNo, you don\u2019t need to count calories or macronutrients, but awareness of what is going into your body is key. In order to look and FEEL your best, the body requires all three macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein and fat. Try to include all three categories every time you sit down for a meal. If you miss one during one meal, make up for it the next! Again, flexibility is key.\n \nExamples of carbohydrates include: vegetables, grains, fruits.\n \nExamples of protein include: chicken, salmon, quinoa, beans.\n \nExamples of fat include: avocado, nuts, olive oil.\n \n*** Note that the caloric value of fats is necessary but DOES add up fast, so I recommend measuring out these foods before consumption.\n \n5. Drink Water:\n \nTip: drink a full glass of water before every meal to help curb your appetite.\n \nThe benefits of water consumption cannot be reiterated enough! Drinking water promotes weight loss by removing the by products of fat from the body. On top of that, it fills your stomach, helping you differentiate between real hunger and thirst, which your body can misinterpret as hunger.\n \n6. Take a well rounded approach to fitness:\n \nThe benefits of eating well and adopting healthy lifestyle habits go far beyond the physical. The mental changes you experience are immeasurable. Of course, the specifics vary depending on the person. From my experience, I have less self doubt and stress, along with more energy, confidence, and happiness since adopting a healthy lifestyle. Unknowingly, these benefits manifest much more quickly than the physical goal and seep into all facets of your life: relationships, work or school, and social life. Being consciously aware of these changes will help you appreciate this amazing journey and the progress you have made so far."

Looking to ensure you move forward properly to ensure optimal results?\n \nWhen it comes to forming a workout, there are many ways you can go about getting the job done. There is not one \u2018perfect\u2019 strength training or cardio workout program for everyone, but rather, one that\u2019s right for you.\n \nThis said, there are some important ground rules that everyone should remember when forming their workout program. If you are not abiding by these rules, you could be in for problems down the road.\n \nLet\u2019s look at the seven important commandments of an effective workout program.\n \nCommandment #1: Thou Shall Prioritize Compound Lifts\n \nBicep curls, leg extensions, lunges, squats, push-ups\u2026 there are so many exercises, how can you choose?\n \nFirst, prioritize the compound exercise. A compound exercise is one that utilizes more than one muscle group at once, thus you are getting a higher overall level of calorie burning as well as strength progression.\n \nThis includes moves like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, bent over rows, shoulder presses, lunges, and pull-ups. Do these first and foremost in your program. Once they are scheduled in, then you can begin focusing on the other more isolated exercises.\n \nIn some cases, you may not even need those isolation exercises depending on what your goal is and what type of workout program set-up you\u2019re using.\n \nCommandment #2: Thou Shall Obey The 48 Hour Rest Rule\n \nNext, make sure that you are always obeying the 48 hour rest rule. What does this mean? It means that you must be taking at least 48 hours between workouts for the same muscle group.\n \nThis is the total amount of time it\u2019s going to take for your muscles to recover appropriately between sessions. So if you hit chest on Monday, don\u2019t do any chest focused exercises until Wednesday at the earliest.\n \nBut remember, because you hit shoulders while hitting chest (as they are called into play as well), this means shoulders should not be done until Wednesday as well.\n \nThis can take a good amount of planning on your part, but if done properly, will make a big difference in the level of recovery and results that you see.\n \nCommandment #3: Thou Shall Incorporate Sufficient Variety\n \nAnother important rule of effective workout programming is that you are incorporating enough variety into the workout routine. This not only helps keep you mentally fresh and invested in the program, but it also helps keep your body responding as well.\n \nIf you are going to the gym and doing the exact same workout day after day, guess what? It\u2019s only going to be so long before your body gets bored. And, when your body gets bored, you stop seeing results.\n \nIf you are stuck in a progress plateau, try changing things around. Usually this is enough to get your results moving again. It doesn\u2019t need to be big changes you are making either. Something as simple as using a different rep range or changing the exercises you\u2019re performing around should be sufficient.\n \nCommandment #4: Thou Shall Not Skip Warm-Ups\n \nShort on time in the gym? Figure you\u2019ll bypass the warm-up to save time? You might want to think again.\n \nWarm-ups are a must. Yes, they will take an additional five to ten minutes out of your workout routine, but they help ensure that you are going to see optimal results as your muscles will be firing stronger, thus you\u2019ll be able to lift more weight.\n \nOh, and they help you avoid injury as well. If you are injured, you won\u2019t be doing any exercise, so clearly this is critical. Take the time and do the warm-up. You\u2019ll be thankful you did.\n \nCommandment #5: Thou Shall Always Use Proper Form\n \nUsing proper form is also a necessity when it comes to seeing great results. Too many people let their ego get in the way. They add weight sooner than they should be and even though the form is sacrificed, keep going.\n \nThis usually leads them to either not seeing results at all, or worse, ending up injured.\n \nThe minute you move out of good form, stop the exercise. Lighten the load and start again. Using good form will ensure you are hitting the muscles are you are supposed to for that movement, guaranteeing you see superior results.\n \nCommandment #6: Thou Shall Apply Overload\n \nNext, it\u2019s also a must that you apply proper overload. If you go into the gym and don\u2019t challenge your muscles, you can\u2019t expect to see results. It\u2019s that simple.\n \nOverload can come in the form of more reps performed or more weight lifted. It doesn\u2019t really matter as long as you get it done one way or another.\n \nRemember, you need a change in your workout in order to get your body to change. If you aren\u2019t changing anything, there\u2019s no motivation to get stronger or more fit.\n \nCommandment #7: Thou Shall Have Fun\n \nFinally, the last commandment is one that is too often neglected - fun. That\u2019s right, your workouts should be fun as well. If you aren\u2019t having fun in the gym, the chances that you keep going back for more are going to be a lot less and you might just find that you forgo exercise all together.\n \nWith so many different ways to structure your workout, there\u2019s no reason to not have fun. If your current plan isn\u2019t enjoyable, try a few new types of exercises instead.\n \nRemember that you don\u2019t even have to be doing exercises in the gym to get in a great workout either. You can take your workouts outdoors, to the local park, or to a sporting field if that\u2019s what you prefer as well. Exercise comes in many shapes and forms and while not all variations will yield the same results, having fun needs to be a priority.\n \nSo keep these points into consideration as you plan out your workout program. By doing so, you\u2019ll help ensure you see maximum success."

But after a few weeks, your strength will increase, and you will find yourself getting worn out. If you what to gain mass, you need to focus on individual parts of your body. It also depends if you want to be a body builder or just get big a strong. If you want to get big, just do compound movements, like squats, deadlifts, bench press and rowing movements for your back. Basically you are working your largest muscles, that will work you hard and burn \ud83d\udd25 calories, and condition your cardio respiratory system. Even if you want to become a body builder, I believe that's where you would start. The smaller muscles with automatically grow because of the metabolic boost from working these large muscles. Do this for about 6 months. But always remember to learn the proper form for any movements you do. Go very light and build up. Squats for example, take some time to get comfortable doing. Do not rush to get huge. Safety and consistency and great nutrition, and make sure you are fully recovered between workouts. The growth and strength increases happen out of the gym. After six months, reevaluate, if you want to become a body builder, you can start doing your smaller muscles, like triceps, biceps, shoulders, forearms and calfs. One other very important caveat, learn to stretch your muscles after your workouts, not before. If you do not stretch regularly, our bodies get tight as we age and it leads to joint problems etc. I love to do zone 2 training on a bike or stationary bike, or I use the stair machine. Zone 2 is under the lactate threshold. Which means you can carry on a conversion for a couple of sentences but no so easy that you could sing a song. I use a heart rate monitor since the first came out I believe in the late eighties. I am 64, I have been doing fitness for 35 years consistently. I hope this helps you with your focus to have a plan and a goal for every workout you do. And never give it up throughout your life. It is one one the greatest gifts to yourself. I will not say good luck, I don't believe in luck, I believe in our greatest gift, our mind."

As it is you need first to shock your muscles and then let them rebuild, this takes longer than 24 hours\u201d.

I'm now 64 and maintaining as much muscle mass is no longer just for asthenics, it's Essential for a a mobile and healthy old age."

By hitting each muscle 3 times a week but giving your body more rest overall allows more muscle growth. Also I used to waste a lot of time working on isolation exercises and wasn't doing much the second half of the workouts anyways I still do a little mobility, stretching and walking on off days. I have made a lot of progress and the effort throughout the week is much less. It's crazy! With that being said it's still good to switch it up. I'll do an upper/lower or push/pull/legs split time to time."

The compound exercises allow one to train the entire body using just a few exercises (squats, deadlifts, presses, rows, power cleans) and the training session will be short (under 45 minutes) which will allow proper recovery and avoid overtraining. I think that training the entire body with single set, isolation exercises would take too long and would impair proper recovery.\n \nBUT, I do think that single set, isolation exercises can be effective if used to build up a lagging bodypart, like biceps or calves, and the rest of the body is trained with compound exercises."

Others do really well on high volume!\n \nIn general, I tend to recommend more volume for those that want to improve size, as the research shows that gains tend to scale quite linearly with volume. However, it might not be that clear, for a few reasons.\n \nHigh volume training\n tends to increase \nsarcoplasm \nin the muscle. This is like your fuel tank-it includes glycogen storage as well as mitochondria for energy production needed during high volume training.\nSo, if you train with high volumes, your body can adapt by making your fuel tank bigger. Makes sense, right? This looks like muscle\u2026because it basically \nIS \nmuscle. It\u2019s \nin \nthe muscle and it looks like muscle from the outside. It\u2019s muscle\u2026just a different type.\n \nBut\u2026it won\u2019t really make you \nstronger\n. In fact, pound for pound, it\u2019ll actually make you \nWEAKER\n, as it doesn\u2019t help your strength, but does add weight!\n \nIt\u2019s not contractile tissue!\nMuscle is mostly water\u2026and then protein\u2026but there is glycogen and fat there, too. That\u2019s sarcoplasm. Fuel tank.\n \nSo, a lot of these studies are switching people from low (or no) volume programs to high volume programs, and finding that their muscles get bigger. A big part of what they are often seeing is the fuel tank getting bigger in response\u2026\nnot \nthe actual muscle fibers!\n \nI\u2019d wager that after a few weeks of going back to lower volume training (or nothing)\u2026a lot of those gains are going to be lost, because they body doesn\u2019t really need as big of a fuel tank anymore. It\u2019s temporary. It\u2019s transient. If I do high volume and then go on vacation, in a week or two, that extra weight is GONE. It\u2019s often up to 4\u20135kg, and it\u2019s not preventable with eating more. It\u2019s a response to training.\n \nIt\u2019s a longer-duration pump.\nArnold\n \nloved \nthe pump\u2026he often trained forty, fifty, sixty sets per workout before competitions. And he responded marvelously to it.\n \nHe bench pressed north of 500lbs when he was a young man, but during his Mr. Olympia prep, most sets seemed to be with 2\u20133 plates per side-just 225\u2013315lbs, about 50\u201360% of 1 rep max!\n \nFor set, after set, after set.\nSerge Nubret\n did as well-he did mostly sets of 15\u201320 reps far away from failure his entire career. Sometimes his workouts lasted \nFIVE HOURS\n, and he did them 6 times per week.\n \nPlus, he was French, so it was literally a full time job!\n \nWill this work for you?\n \nMaybe. But probably not.\n \nWithout anabolics, this type of training isn\u2019t nearly as effective for size.\n \nMost strong advocates for \nhigh volume training \nare on drugs.\n \nDoing endless sets will just leave you tired, battered and injured.\n \nHowever\u2026the thing is, most strong advocates for \nlow volume training\n are also on drugs.\n \nThe Dorian and Menzer method of one all out set to failure works for naturals\u2026but best with pharmaceutical enhancement.\nThey are ALWAYS growing, so they can get away with this type of training.\n \nFor naturals, both high volume and low volume are death sentences for gains.\n \nWhy?\n \nHigh volume\n will cause an increase in cortisol, which is very catabolic and can cause muscle breakdown. It can also cause a decrease in testosterone, and if you are natural you don\u2019t have the luxury of ignoring that. High volume will pump you up, but after a few weeks you\u2019ll plateau hard. Your sarcoplasm can only get so big.\n \nLow volume\n isn\u2019t enough stimulation for a natural to grow optimally in \nmost \ncases. Especially if you cannot push a set close to or to TRUE failure, then low volume training will be crap for gains. Guess what? Most people cannot-or at least, do not.\n \nI think in five years, I\u2019ve seen maybe five people go to true failure in the gym\u2026let alone go beyond failure. Part of that is because I\u2019m in China where the gym culture is new\u2026but I think globally, people training HARD is just quite rare. I typically train quite \nclose\n \nto\n \nfailure\n.\nIt\u2019s just how I\u2019m wired.\n \nFor a natural, ideally you need a mix. Moderate volume most of the time, occasional high volume blocks, occasional low volume blocks with the odd week or two totally off.\n \nSometimes to failure, sometimes a few reps shy, sometimes completely avoiding it, especially if your goal is strength as well as size.\n \nYou need to be SMART about how much volume you do. A lot of this is individual, and you\u2019ll have to discover for yourself.\n \nFollow me on \nInstagram \nfor daily diet and training tips!

It will keep recovering until you start your workout.\n \nDoes muscles only grow on rest days?\n \nSo a simple explanation\n \nAnabolic - Creating new tissue, cells or organs.\n \nCatabolic\n - \nBreak down of cells in your body.\n \nOur body can never be in both states at once.\n \nWorking out = Catabolic\n \nWe perform resistance training to cause damage to the muscle fibers.\n \nThis means we enter a catabolic state as we put stress on our body, our body releases these main hormones\nTestosterone\nInsulin Like growth factor(IGF)\nGrowth Hormone(GH)\nCortisol\nWhen we are in a catabolic state, our body is breaking down fat and glycogen to be used as energy.\n \nRecovery = Anabolic\n \nNow that we have caused damaged to the muscle fibers, we begin the process of repairing the muscle fibers. Once the muscle fibers are repaired they increase in size\n \nThis is muscle hypertrophy.\n \nHow does it work?\n \nMuscle growth occurs whenever the rate of muscle protein synthesis(MPS) is greater than the rate of muscle protein breakdown. Both, the synthesis and breakdown of proteins are controlled by complimentary cellular mechanisms. Resistance exercise can profoundly stimulate muscle cell hypertrophy and the resultant gain in strength. However, the time course for this hypertrophy is relatively slow, generally taking several weeks or months to be apparent\n[1]\n \nIt is generally agreed that resistance exercise results in increased MPS in the postexercise recovery period . Indeed, an acute bout of resistance exercise can increase the rate of MPS about two- to fivefold after exercise, and this effect can persist for up to 48 h in fed subjects \n[2]\n \nSo given we can only be in one state at a time, muscle building will only start once you are done working out and you are in your recovery phase.\n \nMuscle building does not mean just taking a day off from the gym.\n \nYou also need to pay special attention to these for hypertrophy\nCaloric surplus diet with sufficient protein\nAdequate sleep\nManage stress levels\nFootnotes\n[1] \nHow Do Muscles Grow?\n[2] \nJournal of Applied Physiology"

It won't work, give them 48\u201372 hours of recovery between concentrated training sessions.\nAssuming you follow this advice, the timeline is still longer than most people like to hear. It takes about 1\" of girth to visibly notice a change in size, which is ~10 lbs you need to gain. Assuming you can gain 2 lbs a month (meaning you're doing a pretty good job of training and eating) and you're looking at about 5 months of training to gain obvious muscle."

Those are all good options, but let me suggest another one that will ensure you leave your workout in full body fashion\u2014enter: full body workout finishers.\n \n\u2014\n \nWhat the heck is a workout finisher?\nA workout finisher is a \nmini workout\n that you slide right at the end of your main workout. Finishers are great because they provide with you a highly effective full body workout in just a few minutes.\n \nBasically, finishers are designed to hurt.\n \nI mean not physically hurt you like getting spartan kicked in the chest would, but they should sting a little (or, a lot). Words and phrases that jump to mind when we\u2019re talking finishers include:\nlactic acid buildup\nburning and searing\nthe darkest of pain caves\nbattery acid pumping through your veins\nI\u2019m sure there are more but you get the idea.\n \nSo, how long should these epic pain-fests last?\n \nWell, there is no perfect answer here, but because the intensity of effort should be quite high I suggest keeping a finisher to around 8 (ish) minutes or less.\n \n\u2014\n \nWhy finishers are awesome\u2026\n \nBelow is the abridged list of why finisher are awesome:\naccelerate fat loss\nextremely time efficient\nincrease work capacity/conditioning\nincrease mental toughness and ability to endure \u201cthe suck\u201d\n\u2014\n \nWhat types of exercises make the best workout finishers?\nAgain, there is no perfect answer here, but my rule of thumb is to\n go lower on the skill side, and higher on the intensity side.\n \nThe reason I say this is that performing a bunch of highly technical/highly skilled movements as a finisher may actually decrease the intensity of effort.\n \nLet me explain.\n \nHighly technical and highly skilled movements require a great deal of finesse. If you\u2019re super tired halfway through a finisher and you literally can\u2019t do another rep of that high skilled movement (such as a muscle up), well my friend, you\u2019re basically left just staring at the piece of equipment, letting your heart rate drop, and honestly not doing a finisher anymore.\n \nThis is the opposite of what you want.\n \nRemember, the goal with a finisher is to finish the workout with intensity. This means you\u2019ll have to put a bit of thought into the exercises you select here. Personally, I\u2019ve found the best exercises for finishers are the ones that allow you to keep grinding out reps, no matter how tired you get.\n \nExamples of these type of grind style exercises include:\nCardio machines\nBattle rope exercises\nVarious types of crawling\nAny sort of loaded carry\nKettlebell or dumbbell swings\nBasic bodyweight movements (pushups, squats, burpees,\u2026etc)\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but it definitely gives us a good place to start.\n \nWhen selecting exercises for a finisher the \nbig take-a-way is to shift more to grind style exercises vs. highly technical/high skilled exercises.\n Again, the point of doing this is to keep you moving, vs. just staring at the bottom of set of rings because you can\u2019t nail your 5th muscle up in the finisher.\n \n\u2014\n \nPutting it all together: 5 badass full body finishers\nFinisher #1\u2192\n \nComplete as many rounds as possible in 6 minutes of:\n10 kettlebell swings\n50 foot goblet carry\n50 foot bear crawl\nFinisher #2\u2192\n \nThree rounds of:\n12 dumbbell front squat\n12 dumbbell walking lunge steps (6 per leg)\n10 jump squats\n10 jump lunges (5 per leg)\nFinisher #3\u2192\n \n30 hand release pushups\n16 burpees\n16 sandbag getups\n20 \nhand release pushups\n8 burpees\n8 sandbag getups\n10 hand release pushup\n4 burpees\n4 sandbag getups\nFinisher #4\u2192\n \nThree rounds of:\n30 second dumbbell farmers carry (heavy)\n30 second bear crawl\n30 second air squats\n30 second dumbbell rack hold\n30 second hollow body hold\nFinisher #5\u2192\n \n60 second stair climber (fast)\n20 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n45 second stair climber (fast)\n15 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n30 second stair climber (fast)\n10 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n \nThese five finishers all pack a potent punch, but for different reasons. However, two commonalities they share is their time effectiveness, and high suck factor rating.\n \n\u2014\n \nFinal thoughts\n \nAs it seems, the answers you seek have already been laid out before you. I just wanted to throw finishers into the mix so you have a plan for \u201cending the workout with some intensity.\u201d The five finishers I listed above will ensure that you finish any workout in full body fashion.\n \nGive them a try. Who knows, you might even love to hate full body workout finishers.\n \nHope this post is helpful.\n \nThanks for reading.\n-Tom C"

Most important, you follow a right diet, alongwith right quantitative micronutrients and macronutrients, you will progress relatively faster than another individual who's just joined the gym when you have, but has something in his mind while exercising and attending phone calls while at the gym.\n \nPicking weights also has a clear edge with genetics.

It changes according to your likes, your pros and your cons. Yes, a certain movement may be easy for you to perform with a relatively bigger weight than your colleague with comparatively less weight; and vice versa in some other movement. One of you could soar over the other somewhere. Who? How? Where?\u2026. It's impossible to talk now; that's genetics. Then you have to work on your weaker aspects and strengthen them.\n \nYou will definitely pick more weight with gradual time. It's foolish to state a fixed time. Understand that the body gets adapted to a certain weight after some time and then we have to pick more, to feel that same punch there. The flow will carry on. Thus, you will definitely pick more weight after some time and maybe much more than you are presently imagining.\n \nYou must also understand your target. What do you want to do? Muscles, strength, lean physique, flexibility? It all can be achieved, but slowly. Only the style of training will differ according to concentration of motive.\n \nSo, Good Luck.

That includes weight lifting, body weight workouts, stretch bands, etc.\n \nFour critical aspects to fitness are: cardio vascular health, strength (including maintaining muscle mass and bone density), flexibility, and balance. For this reason, I include yoga as well, usually 2 (minimally, usually more like 3) to 4 times per week.\n \nFor me, at 70, mostly retired (meaning some flexibility regarding time), this means:\nA daily run 5 to 6 days per week. 3\u20135 short runs of minimally 3 miles, often 4 miles. One long run, by which I mean double digits (10 miles or more). One medium run of about 6\u20138 miles. I *try* to be consistent but do not always make it. For the past 15 years, I have averaged about 1500 miles per year.\nTeaching or taking 3\u20135 yoga classes per week. I do not keep this up while traveling. I average about 125 yoga classes per year.\nStrength workouts. I have been doing strength work, either body weight workouts or (more recently) lifting in the gym about 2 or 3 times per week.\nProbably putting it all together I average 10 workouts of some sort each week. But mostly it is about having fun and feeling good. This stuff is my jam."

Some may benefit from daily workouts, while others may find every other day more suitable.\n \n7. **Rest Days:** \nAllow for rest days to prevent overtraining and reduce the risk of injury. Your body needs time to recover and adapt to the stress of exercise.\n \n8. **Listen to Your Body:** \nPay attention to how your body responds to exercise. If you feel fatigued or notice persistent soreness, consider adjusting your routine or taking additional rest.\n \n9. **Consultation with Professionals:**\n If you have specific health concerns or are starting a new exercise regimen, consult with a healthcare professional or fitness expert to tailor a plan that suits your needs.\n \nRemember, the key is finding a sustainable routine that aligns with your goals and accommodates your lifestyle while promoting overall health and well-being."

A healthy, safe weekly exercise program can come in many different ways. How often you should exercise depends on your fitness goals, where you start exercising, and how much time suits your body.\nThere are general guidelines for how much exercise a healthy adult should get each week. However, how you obtain these quantities may vary. Also, if your fitness goals are higher than your general fitness level, you should probably exercise more often than is generally recommended. Before starting any exercise routine, it is advisable to consult with your healthcare team, especially if you already know risk factors for heart disease.\n \nWeekly exercise recommendations\nFor most people, the foundation of any exercise program should come from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) general exercise guidelines.\nGet at least 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week. You can also do moderate and vigorous cardio at the same time.\nResistance exercises (lifting or bodyweight exercises) should target major muscle groups 2-3 times a week.\nFlexibility training should be done 2-3 times a week to improve range of motion.\nNeuromotor exercise (functional fitness) should be performed 2-3 days a week. Examples include balance, agility, coordination and gait exercises.\nHow you meet (or exceed) these guidelines is up to you. It\u2019s probably easiest to split your workouts into cardio, 2-3 times a week for flexibility/neuromotor/strengthening 2-3 days a week. You should also include at least one day off each week in your exercise program.\n \nWhere do you start?\nHow often you should exercise depends on where you start exercising. Are you new to exercising? It\u2019s best to ask your healthcare team where you should start exercising. In general, exercising 2-3 times a week can be a good start. Once this is possible, you can add more exercise each week. Remember, your main goal is to do any exercise you can, and it\u2019s better than nothing.\nDon\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t start your exercise program with the recommended amount of exercise. Any exercise is good for health. If you have a specific fitness goal, your weekly workouts may look different. For example, if you\u2019re training for an endurance event, you\u2019ll be doing more cardio than the ACSM recommends. If you\u2019re trying to increase your strength specifically, your focus on strength training may be greater, possibly over half the guidelines.\n \nDo strength training 2-3 times a week\nWhatever your fitness goals, you should incorporate strength training into your workouts. Strength training should include a wide variety of exercises and equipment targeting all major muscle groups. In general, it is recommended to perform 2-4 sets of movements per muscle group with 8-12 repetitions.\nOlder adults or those just starting out should do lower-intensity workouts with sets of 10-15 repetitions. A common misconception about strength training is that you need a gym membership. You can do many strength training exercises with your body weight anywhere. For example, push-ups, squats, sit-ups, and sit-ups are all examples of strength exercises that you can do anywhere.\n \nHow much cardio should you do?\nThe ACSM guidelines of 2.5 hours of moderate exercise per week can be broken down in different ways:\n5 days a week, 30 minutes each time (can be completed in 10 minutes)\n3 days a week, 60 minutes each time (30 minutes above the guideline)\nCombination of moderate to high intensity exercise\nDepending on your goals and your starting point, you need to do how much cardio and what types of exercise. Examples of moderate exercise include: walking, jogging, dancing, gardening, football, etc. Moderate exercise can be sustained without leaving you out of breath. The heart rate increases, but this rate can be maintained for a while.\n \nHow Much Flexibility and Stretching Should You Do?\nExercise recommendations tend to focus on strength training and cardio. However, flexibility and neuromotor exercises should not be forgotten. Flexibility and neuromotor training can easily be combined before or after strength training or cardio.\nFor example: stretching before and after exercise, dynamic warm-ups, yoga, Pilates and balance exercises. Muscles should be warm before doing stretches. Hold the stretch for 10-30 seconds and repeat 2-4 times.\n \nFollow us:\nhttps://lifebuddy.siterubix.com/"

Also, For high-intensity workouts, you shouldn\u2019t take more than 30minutes.\n \nThe reason is that when you take longer than necessary time to workout hoping to get more achievement from it, it backfires because instead of your body releasing HGH hormones, the workout forces your body to perceives stress.\n \nThen your adrenal glands make and release the hormone cortisol into your bloodstream. It is often called the \u201cstress hormone,\u201d and cortisol causes an increase in your heart rate and blood pressure."

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes."

And there is some value in it, if only just for entertainment sometimes (especially on the internet). But let's just get one thing straight here - if you are doing \nany\n kind of workout then it's going to have a greater impact than if you weren't. Simple as that.\n \nOf course there are caveats. You don't want to get hurt, so they can pretty much all be summed up into one commandment: Thou shalt not be an idiot. Getting under a bar loaded with 495 lbs and squatting it is an experience reserved for a very small percentage of people. There is zero reason to think that you need to do that unless you are 100% sure you can. And the people that do it take safety precautions when they do because they know s@&t can go sideways for the best of us so it makes sense to be prepared. That doesn't mean don't lift heavy. It \ndoes\n mean that heavy is a relative concept, not an absolute one. If 95 lbs feels super-heavy to you on bench then guess what? It is. The dude on the bench next to you repping 315 is not relevant to your perception.\n \nYou know all the things people like to give huge importance to? Things like \u201cHow long should I rest between sets?\u201d, \u201cHow many reps should I do?\u201d, \u201cAre preacher curls better than standing curls?\u201d, \u201cShould I drink a protein shake during my workout or after? How long after?\u201d \u2026 are all interesting questions but the truth is the answers have more to do with refinement than gross progress. Get in, lift weights, eat food and don't be an idiot and you will build muscle.\n \nThen there's cardio. Want to create a calorie deficit? Do cardio. Want to improve your heart\u2019s performance? Do cardio. Should you do HIIT? Sure. Why not. Should you do long, slow duration? Sounds good. My rule for cardio is this: if you're just putting in the time then you won't get too much out of it. Come up with little challenges for yourself and then beat them. Maybe it's a certain calories/minute average. Maybe it's maintaining a certain speed for a certain time. Maybe it's keeping your heart rate above a certain number. Maybe it's that you want your shirt to be fully drenched when you're done. Whatever it is I promise that setting a goal and then beating it will ensure your cardio has an impact. Getting too detailed about it is great for refinement but once again the gross value is in making it happen.\n \nMost of us who train won't be Mr. Olympia, or win an Ironman triathlon. At the elite levels there are little refinements that need to be made, but those vary on an individual basis. For the general population who wants to be fit, healthy and strong (and look good along the way) overthinking is overwhelming. As Nike so perfectly puts it, just do it."

However, the gym is more crowded at this time of day and you have to strategically pick which exercise to start with.\n \nYou put your headphones in, find an empty machine, and get to work.\n \nThe right song comes on, you start sweating, and you feel your heart pounding as you crush your workout.\n \nAn hour and fifteen minutes later (due to some waiting for machines) you finish up and head for the door.

You progress as much as you can over a period of time \n(usually about 4 weeks for most folks and to keep things relatively simple) \nthen back off a little and let nature do it's thing -- \ncompensate for all the training.\n \nWeight loss requires inefficient workouts, so you need to track your efficiency and improvement. If you're fast, then maybe distance based training is more inefficient. If you're good with distance than maybe speed based training is more inefficient. You want to cycle to more inefficient methods that your body isn't as comfortable with roughly every 4 or so weeks to keep your body adapting.\n \n30 minutes of walk/run is a good place to start but your body will quickly become adapted to that stimulus if it stays the same for too long. \n \nSo assuming you're only using this method, here are some ideas on what to track so you're progressively overloading your 30 minute walk/run:\n \nSpeed\nHeart Rate\nDistance\nRest\nSpeed\n \nIf you're running at 6mph and walking at 3mph then obviously bumping up your speeds means you're improving.

This is assuming you're using something like a treadmill but you could do the same outside with a GPS tracker. \n \nThe faster you run the less length of time you'll be able to maintain that speed so faster intervals often require more rest and burn a little more. They are also generally more effective in my experience for fat loss, but periodic improvement, change and variety trumps high intensity interval training still.\n \nObviously the faster you go the more rest you need, but you might not want to start sprinting right away, work up to it over the first few months. \n \nHeart Rate\n \nRequires a heart rate monitor, I'd recommend a chest strap as they are the most accurate and will work with pretty much any kind of equipment at the gym. If you can work at a greater speed with a lower heart rate, then your cardiovascular fitness is improving, if you start to notice that improvement taper off over time (like after 4 weeks of training) then it's a good idea to switch what you're doing or switch what you're measuring.\n \nAnother thing you can watch for is what we call Heart Rate Recovery, or how quickly your heart rate comes back down after you run back to a walk. The faster this is, the more cardiovascularly fit you are and I'd argue this is more important in the grand scheme of things than heart rate alone. If the speed of your recovery tapers off, again you need a change and/or you should consider shortening your rest interval of your walk-run, or increasing the speed of one or the other.\n \nDistance\n \nIf you cover more distance with the same walk run protocol in the same time frame, obviously you improved speed. Covering more distance in the same time frame is an indication you are getting more fit, if this tapers off, again another indication that something needs to change. You could also simply make your objective to cover more distance and not worry about tracking speed. The difference of this metric is really just where your focus lies.\n \nRest\n \nLess walking while keeping your running at the same intensity is obviously harder. So you could choose to monitor this and rather than altering the above, just knock 5 seconds off your rest intervals each workout until you can't keep up to your previous work interval \n(an indication you've tapered off and need a change)\n. So you do 6 mph run for 2 minutes, 3 mph walk for 1 minute, then do 55 seconds, 50 seconds, 45 seconds, 40 seconds, 35 seconds, etc....keep the work interval the same if you use this method.\n \nPick one variable to monitor and change either every 4 weeks or when you notice that you're not improving that variable. Don't change a bunch of variables at once. For instance, if you are doing 2 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking, try to bump up your speed to as much as you can handle over a 4 week period, but don't also change the duration of the interval. Next 4 weeks, change the duration of the interval but try to keep the speed consistently as high as you can. Give yourself constraints for improvement and roll with one change at a time for simplicity sake. This also gives you a lot more opportunity for variety every 4 weeks, rather than changing too much at once.\n \nI'd say if 3 workouts in a row are far too similar in progress \n(i.e. you can't get a little bit faster, or take less rest, or run longer than you did 3-4 workouts before)\n then you need to change something, generally if you have enough variety in what you're tracking.\n \nThat's the general principle behind training.\n \nHowever, for fat loss, I'd highly recommend learning how to do some resistance training and add that into your routine every other day \n(conditioning work one day for 30 minutes, resistance training the next for 30 minutes) \nespecially full-body compound movements like squats, deadlifts, presses, pulls, etc...\n \nSee additionally, my answers to:\n \nWhat are the best ways to reduce and eliminate belly, abdominal, and thigh fat?\nHow do you customize a weight loss and exercise plan for yourself?\nWhat should everyone know about strength training and weightlifting?\nWhat is a realistic plan for losing 20% of my body weight?

Depending on how much experience you have with compound movements, especially if your just starting out I would stick to the 3-6 rep range for your first movement and then go from there. Its not set in stone but my second movement is usually in the 6-12 rep range this would be your lunges or other accessory movements. From there you will be moving to possibly your last movements and maybe core work if you are doing it that day and will be your 8-15 rep range.\n \nNow, this is just a guide line, and can be toyed with a little. \n \nYour breaks will change from movement to movement. A guide would be  2-3 minutes for the first movement and all compound movements, 1-2 for the second movement, and then 1-1:30 for the rest of the movements.\n \nThe rest can change sometimes, there will be times where you want to keep the rest very limited and then there will be times when you want to rest a little extra. Your goals will dictate your rest for the most part.\n \nDepends what you want to get out of your training. The harder you push yourself the more you will get out of it. You don't need to spend hours in the gym a day but when your there push yourself. \n \nMusic? Yes!\n \nHope this helps, feel free to email me at rossy@mattrossignol.com if you have any questions."

They do not have as much testosterone, but actually secrete higher growth hormone than men. Growth hormone will allow you to build a tighter/leaner physique. \n \nSince diet is 80% of any fitness goal, I'd stick to lean protein + veggies 5 times a day. Drink plenty of water in between meals. Have a refeed, carb heavy meal for one of your meals every 4th or 5th day. This will keep your fat burning hormones charged. And remember, it's not about finding time, but making time. The president trains 45 mins a day 6 times a week, and he's the busiest man alive.

There are simply degrees of effectiveness based on your goals, training age, training history, genetics, etc. \n \nIf you want to get strong, functional strength an upper body and lower body split is a great way to go. \nI prefer to use primarily free weights (barbells and dumbbells, and bodyweight), which tend to recruit a higher percentage of muscle fibers\nYour idea rep range will depend on your goals. Check out Prilepin tables for a rough guide:\nYour rest periods will depend on your training. The heavier you're lifting, the longer rest you need between sets. If you're training in the 1-5 rep range, you may need 4-5 minutes rest between sets. This will decrease as you move to lower rep ranges. If you're training with 9-12 reps, you may only need 30-60 seconds of rest between sets. (Keep in mind this is just a rough guideline)@\nPush yourself to technical failure (not absolute failure). Meaning: once your form stars to deteriorate, you should stop within 1-2 reps. Remember: your body ALWAYS adapts to EXACTLY what you do and continuing to train after technical failure will engrain bad movement patterns. \nDefinitely listen to music! Anything that helps get you in the right head space and contributes to a positive training experience is a huge bonus. Music has powerful psychological effects and it is smart to harness these in training. \nSome recommended books that helped me early in my journey:\nStarting Strength by Mark Rippetoe\n5/3/1 by Jim Wendler\nStretching Scientifically by Thomas Kurz\nHow to Eat, Move, and Be Healthy by Paul Chek"

This means that in order to build strength, \nyou\u2019ll want to lift heavier weights for shorter durations\n, rather than lighter weights for longer durations.\n \nNow, there are many different (often conflicting) schools of thought on how to optimally stimulate the body so as to build strength, so I don\u2019t want to offer anything as the be-all, end-all of strength building, but \nhere\u2019s a general structure that should at least get you started\n:\n \n-Compound exercises (exercises that involve more than one joint such as leg press, chest press, compound row, etc.) will be the most effective and efficient exercises. You can do isolation exercises as well (like bicep curls, etc.), but I would suggest you start your workouts with the compounds for optimal results.\n \n-For a given exercise, find a weight that will completely fatigue your muscles in about 1\u20132 minutes. Anything you cannot do for at least a minute is probably too heavy, and anything over two minutes is probably too light to stimulate the best results (as far as strength is concerned).\n \n-Try not to let your muscles relax for the entire duration of each exercise. So for example, if you\u2019re using a leg press machine, don\u2019t lock your legs out, and don\u2019t rest the weights at the bottom. Keep moving and keep the muscles working the whole time. (This is important! Resting during an exercise allows your slow-twitch (endurance) muscle fibers a chance to recover, limiting engagement from fast-twitch (strength) fibers and therefore limiting your improvements in strength.)\n \n-Perform as many repetitions as you can, \nslowly\n*,\n until you can no longer \nsafely\n** \ncontinue (ie. muscle failure).\n \n*Emphasis on moving \nslowly\n because moving quickly means you are using momentum to carry the weight up/forward, and using gravity to assist on the way back. \nGo slowly and embrace the burn.\n \n**Emphasis on \nsafely\n because people tend to sacrifice form after getting carried away with thinking that the goal of exercising is to do as many repetitions as possible. It\u2019s not. The goal of exercise is to stimulate a response in the body. \nKeep good form\n, challenge yourself, and when you can no longer move the weight with good form, stop and slowly set the weight down.\n \n-One \ngood\n set (ie., total muscle failure) per exercise \nshould\n be sufficient. This might be a controversial take, but this is how I exercise, and it saves me a lot of pain and time, and limiting myself to one set doesn\u2019t seem to effect my results (as far as strength is concerned). Your results may vary, however, especially early on when you\u2019re learning to push yourself, so if you want to do multiple sets, knock yourself out.\n \nTL;DR\n: Lift and lower the weights slowly, with good form, without resting, until your muscles become completely fatigued and you can no longer complete your final repetition, which ideally would occur between 1\u20132 minutes.\n \nI hope this helps; good luck!"

Plan your week such that you have a rest day in your weekly training split.\n \nWhen you are trying to \ngrow Lean Muscle Mass\n,\n the rest timing becomes very crucial, because it is in the rest and recovery that you actually grow(along with a good nutrition plan of course). Thus for such a goal \n3\u20135 days split\n ,with 4th and 6th day as rest is ideal.\n \nIf you are someone who is \ntrying to shed fat\n, then \n5\u20136 days \nwith mix of Strength and Cardiovascular training split would be ideal. Where 5th day can be your rest day.\n \nNow, someone like a bodybuilder would usually train a min \n5 times\n in a week during his/her offseason, and in prep season , it gradually increases up to \n14 times a week, \nwhere\n 14 times \nusually comprises\n of 2 sessions per day, one in the morning and one in the eve. \nAnd that even will be done around last month before competition. 3\u20134 days before competition i drops, and reduces to only 2\u20133 sessions of light full body circuit training just to sharpen the conditioning.\nMyself\nThen there are even more seasoned athletes like \nOlympic lifters\n, who train and practice almost all the 3 main Olympic lifts along with accessory workouts to improve their execution \n6 times a week\n. Their routines are so complex and dynamic that they have to train and practice everyday and sometimes twice a day. And they usually have one single day of complete rest in a week.\nIndia Olympic Lifter \nMirabai Chanu\nSomeone like a \nmarathon\n runner might practice running \n3 to 5 times\n a week to work upon their endurance stamina and improve their mileage over time.\nAnd also the training frequency for you to reach your fitness \nGOAL\n will depend upon :\nYour timeline to accomplish goal. One word- \nREALISTIC.\n Be \nRealistic\n about your timeline.\nYour current body stats- \nBMI\n, \nLean Fat Free Muscle Mass\n, \nBody Fat Percentage\n etc\nYour \ncurrent\n \nPhysical strength \nlevel\nYour \npre-existing medical conditions\n(if any) Consult your doctor in case you have any such conditions which can pose a risk to your health and lead to medical contraindication.\nRemeber\n\u201cTrain with a purpose.

        "answer": "Monday: Cardio.

I\u2019ll also dial back the number of sets if I\u2019m not feeling it. Sometimes life happens and I miss days, and I have to take it easy if I miss more than one in a row. I\u2019m not in my 20s (or 30s) anymore.\n \nReasons: Squat, bench, and deadlift are to get good at squat, bench, and deadlift. I\u2019m looking to get up to a three plate squat, 250 bench, and double body weight deadlift. Also general strength helps in daily life. Pull ups, RDLs, and overhead press are accessory movements to assist with bench and deadlift. Cable rows are to keep my bad shoulder from acting up. Curls are because, to quote Megan Gallagher, \u201cBiceps make me feel pretty.\u201d Ab work is because I get tested on sit-ups. Cardio is because I get tested on cardio and to keep my heart and lungs working right despite the other bad stuff I do to them."

Based on my own experience and some literature and books I read I have tried to sum up the basics of these components below.\n \n1)\n \nStrength Training\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nFirst let us understand what it is not. It is often misunderstood as bulking up and building 6-packs ab and Salman like biceps for show-off. So most people feel that they don\u2019t really need it. WRONG!\n \nIt is actually defined as a type of anaerobic physical exercise that by the use of resistance specializes in\n \n>\nIncreasing Muscular Fitness (Increases muscle strength, muscle mass and size)\n \n>Increasing Bone Strength and bone density\n \n>Increasing Tendon and Ligament Strength\n \n>Improving Joint Function\n \nApart from these benefits in aids in health improvement ,increases metabolism, aids in fat loss, overall fitness levels ,improved lipid profile (improves the good cholesterol) etc.\n \nHence it is absolutely critical component.\n \nHow you can do It :- \nOne has following options to do it.\n \na)\n \nAt Gym using various equipments\n :- You can perform it at GYM. All you need to make sure is that you need to have a good sensible trainer.\n \nYou may do it 2-3 times/week for an hour each.\n \nb)\n \nAt Home using Resistance band\n :- This is another option that you may perform at your home. You may order the band online (Cosco is a good brand),some good videos (10 min-30 min) are available online to learn and do the exercises along with the video. Convenience is better in this option but the drawback is that you won\u2019t have good control on the exact amount of resistance. But it can be done on days when you look for some light strength sessions.\n \nc)\n \nAt Home using Body weight\n :- The 5 basic strength exercises \u2013 Push Up ,Pull Up, Dips, Sit-ups and Squats are key to overall strength. Rather than working on isolated muscles they work on large muscle groups. You may do these in conjunction with band/dumbbells or standalone also. You can also do exercises like Lunges, Mountain Climbers, bridges etc.\n \nd)\n \nAt Home using dumbbells \n:- If you know the basics right you may perform the entire exercises that you do on equipments in a Gym at your home only. You can do good variations with just a set of \n2 and 5 kgs of dumbbells\n using proper form and by doing the moves slowly. This can be started at any age by using a set of 2 Kg dumbbells and is often a most neglected part.\n \nDon\u2019t forget to warm up before starting the strength training sessions. You may like to wind up with a 5 min stretching session.\n \n2)\n \nCardio Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters \n:- Cardio is any form of exercise/activity that is designed to work the cardiovascular system that raises your heart rate and breathing and consequently an increase in the circulation of blood and oxygen throughout the body for an extended period of time. Getting your body to sweat also helps you to release toxins that would otherwise build up in your tissues. The benefits range from weight loss, improved Heart health, improved Lung health, improved stamina, improved immunity, stabilized blood pressure,increased energy levels,more active and dynamic lifestyle, reduced mood swings etc.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nYou may\n \nenjoy any of the below/club them/etc. to get the benefits. Go for a variety rather than repeating the same all the time.\n \na)\n \nFast Walking/Light Jogging :- \nJust go to a park nearby and enjoy fresh unpolluted morning air, get some sunlight and do fast walk/light jog to start the day.\n \nb)\n \nTreadmill /Elliptical machine/stationary cycling \n:- Good for those rainy seasons\n \nc)\n \nCycling \n:- You may incorporate use of a bicycle to go to nearby places etc. or do it as a part of exercise weekly.\n \nd)\n \nSwimming \n:- One of the best cardio exercises. Just use googles and caps to avid the chlorine side effects.\n \ne)\n \nAerobic Dance Workouts \n:- In Youtube you have some good videos that you may see and do along.\n \nf)\n \nP-T exercises \n:- Remember the school days. Those exercises can still be incorporated.\n \ng)\n \nStair climbing \n:- Avoid lifts and take stairs.\n \nh)\n \nRope Jumping\n :- Good if you enjoy it.\n \n3)\n \nFlexibility Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters \n:- Flexibility may be defined as the ability of our joints and body parts to execute their full range of motion. Flexibility deteriorates rapidly with a sedentary lifestyle and without adequate flexibility you are more prone to injuries and with tight muscles daily activities become difficult to perform. We create body movement and posture habits which tend to reduce joint mobility. The benefits of flexibility exercises are less back pain, increased range of motion, injury prevention ,improved circulation, less stress, better posture and confidence. A flexible body a flexible spine ultimately leads to a flexible mind which is more adaptive . Practicing Yogaasanas daily is the most perfect and easiest way to obtain a flexible body and a clear mind It would help one to tone the muscles, skeletal system, nourish the body tissues and burn fat. It is excellent for all internal organs and various yoga asanas target specific parts and organs of the body like vertebra, Joints, neck, shoulder, heart, lungs, kidney etc. It will also improve your balance both physical and emotional.\n \nHow you can do it \n:- As I have already written above that YOGAASANAS are the most perfect way to flexibility.. You don\u2019t have to do complicated postures at all , just simple basic stretching asanas have to be done with awareness of breath. You really have to be at ease during each posture and you shouldn\u2019t feel any pain. One very good 22 minute video is that of a sequence called \u201cPadmasadhna\u201d which consists of 12 yogaasanas, it is taught in Art of living advance course but can be easily practiced by anyone. You may also learn asanas from any yoga instructor near your place, but you can learn simple asanas yourselves with videos.One video called Shilpa Yoga is also very well designed. Below are some common asanas which you can simply google :-\n \na)\n \nLying Asanas\n:-Ardha Halasana,Sethu Bandhasana,Naukasana,Makarasana,Shalabhasana,Bhujangasana,Dhanurasana,Kativakraasana and shavasana\n \nb)\n \nSitting Asanas\n \n:- Vrajrasana,Parvatasana,Shashankasana,Marjariasana,Vyaghrasana,Janu Shirshasana,Gomukhasana,Padmasana,Budhkonasana and Adho Mukh Shvanasana\n \nc)\n \nStanding Asanas\n:-Tadasana,Prishtasana,Padhastasana,Vriksasana,Natrajasana,Utkatasana,Trikonasana,Veer Bhradraasana,Konasana and Kati chakrasana.\n \n4)\n \nBreathing Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nBreathing exercises are basically an activity that would involve taking breaths consciously. Every emotion has an impact on our breath eg when we are happy and relaxed we breathe deeply, when we are in anger we automatically take short breaths etc. Now our motive is to control these emotions/feelings but we often find ourselves not able to keep them under control. The best way to achieve this is through control of breath ,when we do breathing exercises and learn conscious breathing we are able to control our emotions as well, it\u2019s like a remote control to our emotions. If we observe ourselves there are two type of actions a) Voluntary b) Involuntary. Voluntary actions are the ones that we do consciously like talking, walking, moving our hands, eating drinking etc. .Involuntary actions are the actions that are taken care of by the conscious energy that resides within us like conversion of oxygen to carbon dioxide by our cells, digestion of food, pumping of blood by our heart ,all cellular actions etc. The thing with breath is that when we are not aware of it, it is involuntary but when we become aware of it and start breathing with awareness it becomes voluntary and we can control it. Hence it is a transit between Voluntary to Involuntary, Known to Unknowable, manifested to Unmanifested it is a jump into the divine. Hence breathing exercises or pranayama have found an unique place in our Vedas, yoga pradipikas, yoga sutras and more recently in Medical Science as well .\n \nOur lung function is obviously improved and more quantity of oxygen reaches and nourishes every single cell that restores health, youthfulness and cheerfulness.\n \nHow you can do it :- T\nhey may be classified as the nature of breaths we take\n \na) slow/deep/long breaths eg Anulom Vilom & Nadi Shodhan (Alternate Nostril Breathing), Deep Ujvai Breaths,3- Stage Pranayama, Simple Deep Breathing, Abdominal Breathing\n \nb) short/rapid/quick blasts of breaths eg. Kappal Bhatti,\n \nc) cyclic rhythm including a blend of both eg\n. \nSudarshan Kriya\n \nas taught in the Art of Living\n \n5)\n \nMeditation\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nMeditation is actually \u201cDoing Nothing\u201d. You just sit with eyes closed and just as a witness observe your own thoughts without judging without comparing without imagining, without labeling. It gives us deep rest, far deeper than what sleep offers you. Meditation makes you more Dynamic, more lively, more focused, improves your concentration, improves your happiness quotient, highly raises your healing power. Other benefits are\n \n>Keeps you stress free\n \n>Reduces aging\n \n>Helps you to appreciate life more\n \n>Helps you feel more connected\n \n>Improves Brain Function\n \n>Helps you give good sleep\n \n>Increases Immunity\n \n>Increases your awareness and attention\n \n>You gain control over your mind\n \nIn this 10 minutes you would realise that how our mind exaggerates and magnifies small problems in life and that you have immense potential to face all challenges of life. The most important realization that occurs is that actually \nno incidence or no person or no situation is joyous or sorrowful, it is actually the \u201cSELF-TALK\u201d that we do with ourselves is the source of joy/misery\n. After that even when situations come which tend to make you tensed/stressed by positive self-talk you increase the power of the self and don\u2019t let the negative talks of mind over power you.\n \nWe develop love and compassion with others and let go of our habit of Criticizing, complaining and comparing.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nMeditation should be practiced daily for around 10 minutes. Some guided meditations are available online. You just need to listen to it and let go. You don\u2019t have to do anything, just listen and relax. Initially guided meditations are beneficial, slowly once you get the basics you may not actually need them. You can simple sit and meditate. Just remember that it is not concentration, it is de-concentration.\n \nWe just have to make a schedule for ourself and then stick to it remembering that \n\u201c Self Discipline\u201d is the only thing that makes someone miserable/blissfull,healthy/unhealthy,strong/week\n.\n \n6)\n \nA Balanced Diet\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nJust remember the basic fact that \u201cYou are what you eat\u201d. You would need to get all your macronutrients (carbohydrate, Protein ,fat and water) and all your micronutrients (Vit A, Vit B Complex (B1,B2,B3,B5,B6,B7,B9 and B12),Vit C, Vit D, Vit E,Vit K,calcium,magnesium,iron,zinc,selenium,phosphorous etc ) in order to allow your body to function optimally. I would advise just spend an hour on internet and surf about these nutrients.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nFirst let us discuss about some basic points related to diet :-\n \na)\n \nMindful eating and chewing each bite till it turns liquid\n \n: - Eat mindfully with thankfulness and chew each bite at least 64 times that enhances digestion and nutrient absorption.\n \nb)\n \nAvoid\n all \nFried Products\n (Samosa, Vada, Pakoda, Papad etc.), All \nMaida\n products-Bread , Paw , Naan , Tandoori Roti made of Maida , Bakery Products , Maggi ,Noodles etc., All \nPacket\n Food- Farsana , Mixtures , Chips , Kurkure, Ready to eat products , etc., All \nFast \nFood- Pizza , Burger ,sauces, Junk Food , Hotel Food ,KFC, Mc Donald\u2019s, Chinese Food etc., All \nFatty\n Food-Butter , Cream , Peanut Butter, Nutrilite , Mayonnaise etc\n \nAnd especially for phenytoin you have to stay away from all sodas and cold drinks also.\n \nc)\n \nRefined White Sugar\n :- This is the most dangerous food item on our shelves .It is rightly termed as \u201cWhite Poison\u201d by nutrition experts. Completely eliminate the use of refined white sugar. Date Syrup, Honey and Jaggery are better alternatives as they contain important nutrients , although they should also be consumed within limits as they have high Glycemic Index. Avoid All \nsugar\n Products- Sweets, Cold Drinks ,Chocolates ,Biscuits, Ice-creams, Pastries, Cakes, Tea, Coffee etc.\n \nd)\n \nFruits\n :- Include seasonal fruits a part of your daily food list. Definitely include Guava or peru (for highest Vitamin C), Awla (for highest antioxidants) , Carrot ( for highest vitamin A) daily. Additionally have fruits like pomengranate ,oranges,papaya,banana,apple etc. You should aim for 2-3 servings/day\n \ne)\n \nGrains\n :- Go for variety,don\u2019t restrict you to just one.Ideally try to have one grain only once per day .Have wheat,brown rice,white rice,wheat,ragi,jowar,bajra,Makai.\n \nf)\n \nPulses and Legumes \n:- Select from wide variety of Moong,masoor,arhar dals etc and beans like kidney beans soya beans,chick peas etc as they are high in protein content.\n \ng)\n \nOmega 3 Fatty Acids\n :- Extremely critical to be included in the diet on daily basis. Flaxseeds, Walnuts , Fish and cod liver oil are good sources.You may occasionaly use a cod liver oil supplement\n \nh)\n \nAcid-Alkaline balance\n :- Almost all cooked food tend to have an acidic effect on the body. Try to include raw fruits and vegetables daily to restore the balance.\n \ni)\n \nSeeds and Nuts\n :- Include them daily in your diet plan. Remember to soak the nuts (including peanut ) as un soaked nuts have very high amount of phylates that interfere in Iron absorption.\n \nNuts \u2013 Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Dates, Raisins,\n \nSeeds \u2013 Flaxseeds, Sesame seeds(in winter) , Sunflower seeds, Chia seeds, Basil seeds , Pumpkin seeds.\n \nInclude some roasted gram (Chana), Sattu drink and handful of Sprouts in your daily diet plan.\n \nj)\n \nCooking Oil\n :- never use a single cooking oil all the time. Use a blend of cooking oils, have one for breakfast, another for lunch and another for dinner. Aim for varieties of which one is high in MUFA, one high in PUFA and one which has both in balance .Just see the labels of the cooking oil. Use olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil ,groundnut oil, safflower oil, rice bran oil, coconut oil etc. and keep shuffling between them. The daily intake should be restricted. Ghee could also be used wisely in some quantity. The important thing to remember is that never eat FRIED foods and cook vegetables in less quantity of oil .\n \nk)\n \nAyurvedic Herbs \n:- Use herbs in medicinal form occasionally to boost immunity. Eg Tulsi, Neem, Triphala, Ashwagandha, Guduchhi etc.\n \nl)\n \nVeg Vs Nonveg \n:- Its totally a personal choice. Whilst Non Veg food are rich sources of nutrients like protein and iron they do have an array of drawbacks. One has to decide for himself. I benefitted hugely by switching to being vegetarian from part 3-4 years.\n \nNeedless to mention in the above list that Alcoholic Products, Cigarettes, Tobacco etc. are a Big NO! Remember that our body is the temple where God resides in the form of our soul/consciousness/energy whatever we may like to call it. We are all divine beings and this body is a precious miraculous gift from divinity to us, we should never disrespect it by the intake of such products. \u201cWe are not human beings on a spiritual journey , we are spiritual beings on a human journey\u201d hence the best way to show gratitude to divinity is by taking care of your body!\n \nThe above components if integrated properly would surely raise the self-healing abilities of your body. Just have faith that there is a cosmic intelligence that has fine-tuned the entire universe eg. mass of electron, gravitational constant, electromagnetic constant, distance between earth and sun, composition of air that we breathe and millions of such parameters had to be exactly the same as they are for you and me to exist. Within our cells lies the same intelligence that is driving billions of galaxies. Each cell has the same intelligence by which it is able to perform such complicated functions with such an ease. Each cell in the body is like an universe in itself. This intelligence is working all the time within you and can definitely re fine tune the parameters of your body that have gone out of order. Just set your priorities right and you can surely manage one hour/day ,let these things be an integral part of your life like you brush your teeth, you bath these also shall be included in your daily routine.\n \nHope this helps,\n \nI belong to you! Thanks."

Depending on my fitness level, exercise could be as simple as taking a short walk to increase my heart rate and blood flow.\n \nI don't need an intense workout such as heavy weightlifting or high-intensity interval training (HIIT).\nHow I exercise depends on my health goals. For example, if I want to lose fat and gain muscle, I will focus on heavy compound movements. In addition, my diet is extremely critical.\n \nTo keep myself motivated, I measure my results. Furthermore, I don't compare myself to others because everyone\u2019s body is different. Every person has his or her unique different genetics, health, and fitness history. The only person I compare to is my former self.\n \nI focus on my progress.\n \nPersistence and consistency are the two key factors for achieving my goals.\n \nBreak Through Your Plateau\n \nAfter reaching a certain fitness level, your body will stagnate because it has adapted to those changes. This is great if your goal is to maintain. But if you want to break through the plateau, your body must experience a higher intensity or resistance.\n \nThis is when progressive overload applies.\n \nTo get stronger and have more muscle for a particular body part, your body must experience a higher amount of resistance.\n \nFor example, if you can lift 125 pounds for your barbell military press for 4 to 6 reps and you want more strength and muscles in your shoulders, you must increase the weights during your workouts. Along with proper macronutrients fueling and rest, you will gain more strength and shoulder definition over time.\nBut the process could take longer if you want to increase muscle and strength while minimizing fat. To do so, you can first bulk to gain fat and muscle. Afterward, you can cut to maintain muscle while losing fat.\n \nHowever, if you're new to weightlifting, you can quickly build muscle while losing fat.\n \nFocus on Exercises which Excite You\n \nIf your goal is to maintain optimal health, then performing enjoyable exercises will be your most desirable and sustainable approach. That's because you're more likely to exercise if you look forward to them. Such options might be a dance class, morning group hike, or a run with your dog.\n \nFor example, one of my personal favorite hobbies is rock-climbing.\nAlthough it's challenging, I look forward to going to the rock-climbing gym because I find it extremely fun and engaging. It's both physically and mentally difficult because I have many ways of finishing the problem.\n \nWorking out with a partner can make your exercise session even more enjoyable, not to also mention accountability - you both don't want to let the other person down. In addition to improving your health, you get to spend quality time with them which further deepends your relationship.\n \nProducing many health benefits, exercise is an excellent way to release endorphins, ..."

It isn't as tiring or grueling on your joints as it is when you're doing runs on varied, uneven, and realistic terrain.\n \nI liked going to the gym and rotating between lifting machines like the bicep curl, tricep press, and tricep pushdown when I wanted to blow off steam; but the muscle soreness and stiffness that I got in the inboard side of my elbow (known as the medial epicondyle) was excruciating every time I tried to straighten my arm a day after the workout.\n \nAs a result, I'd have to go to work the next day with my arms squared off in a stiff, rigid, and 45-degree angle. My arms being bent at the elbow and unable to extend without causing agony. People thought I was playing around, \u201cLook at this dick walking around trying to make chicken sandwiches with his robot arms.\u201d\n \nSo cardio became my go to. Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December, and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n \n(Upvote for the Edgar Allan Poe reference? )\n \nI went to exercise at L.A Fitness with a gym rat who practically snorted canisters of preworkout and whey protein. And he had a free guest pass, so I said what the hell. I got the heart, kid! I was always at the disadvantage, but I doggedly followed his workout routine despite feeling I was over training my muscles.\n \nThe days that we were too worn out or didn't have enough time to go through with a full workout, we treated them as cardio days. Immediately, I fell in love with the treadmill.\n \nThe way Mr.Protein saw it, it was either go home with your mind carrying your agonized and hypertrophic corpse in a body bag, or do cardio until you dropped.\n \nSo I grew fond of working to a beat, treading on the elastic band that bounced with a slight resistance as it looped under my feet, and seeing the gorgeous female triathletes who seemed to have unparalleled stamina run alongside me.\n \nI'd start off getting started at a slow and steady 3.5 MPH and would gradually increase the speed by .2 every minute. Often, I'd swap my playlist to an upbeat and fast BPM playlist to challange myself to what I deemed a speed round.\n \nRaised the incline, raised the speed to 6.0 MPH, and raised the resistance. And every twenty seconds, I'd increase the speed by .20\n \nBefore all this, I was always confused as to why people enjoyed running track or doing seemingly linear sports ike cross-country. But then I tried it for myself in the comfort of a warm gym. It feels like you're running away from it all. Not in a bad way. It feels a bit like you're the last mazerunner burdened with dashing through the labrynth-complex that is life.\n \nThere's a controlled rhythm and willpower, and most of the time you'll be too focused on keeping your lungs supplied with oxygen for you to think about much else. It's a fascinating workout all-in-all.\n \nCheers,\n \nDaniel.\n \nSources :\n \nGolfer's elbow - Symptoms and causes"

I hated running in middle and high school (anything before, I probably enjoyed, but don't remember much), mostly because it was forced upon me by the school administration in the form of pacers and the infamous 1 mile runs. \n \nOnce college hit and I began to realize that my health is actually on my shoulders, I ventured into the world of yoga, mainly because it doesn't involve any kind of traditional cardio (i.e. running). I never tried bikram, but hard-core classes like power yoga or advanced vinyasa flow made you sweat and toned and super freakishly flexible. I began jogging when I realized that my heart rate wasn't going as fast as when I first started, and weirdly enough it didn't feel like a work-out without breathing hard. \n \nThe first time I ran more than 2 miles was mind-boggling. And then I ran a 5k (on my own, not in a race and rather slowly), I literally thought I was dreaming and pinched myself. Compared to other avid runners, I'm quite slow, I average probably 10min/mile to 12min/mile depending on the day, but each time I hit another distance (like 5 miles, etc) or time goals (like 5k in 30min, etc), it hooked me. Of course I have days where I absolutely loath putting my running shoes, so I substitute yoga. \n \nOne thing that I have noticed with running more often for longer times and distances is that you can get extremely tight quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, gastrocnemius, essentially all your leg muscles and your abs. So I'm not as stretchy and yoga is actually a bit more painful (I appreciate wooden people's yoga feats more now), which in turn led me to more running. So lots of stretching and sprinkling of yoga along with some healthy goals and good running shoes resulted in this weird love for running. :)"

Experiment with raising the bar to warm up without adding additional weights, and add weights when you feel able to lift them. Hold the bar in such a way that the thumbs are outside the closed fist, and the arms are separated from each other a distance greater than the width of the shoulders, taking care that the angle between the arm from the top and the body is about 45 degrees. Bring the weight closer to the chest before lowering it towards the chest, taking care not to lower the weight directly from its original position without bringing it close to the chest. Take a deep breath and raise the bar again above the chest, with the arms extended, and exhale during the lifting process with a focus on a specific point in the ceiling, then return the bar above the chest, and repeat the exercise"

So if you want big and strong muscles that can withstand the test of time and whatever life throws at you, I recommend you do both. Follow a varied routine that challenges your body in both ways, one week of each, constantly alternating. Doing the same workout every week is both boring and not productive. There is no magical number of sets. When going for mechanical stress it is possible to achieve the desired effect after only 1 set, just make sure warming up properly. When the muscle tissue is torn and damaged, it will start a regenerating process that rebuilds and reinforces the damaged area. Normally it is ok to perform 2 and even 3 sets of this kind of tissue-breaking training, and 2 exercises will be plenty, making sure to hit the muscle from different angles and causing growth in a large area. \n \nFor the metabolical stress effect you will need more reps and less weights, but again- there is no magical number of exercises. Do as many as you want to, and I recommend you superset them or giantset them, in order to hit the same muscle from many different angles, all in one highrep round of exercises. I like to do 3 exercises on each musclegroup, for 3 rounds of trisets, when doing this kind of training. It can come up to a total of 45 reps on one round, doing 15 reps on 3 exercises with no rest in between, on the same muscle. it will give you the most insane feeling of pump, and surely cause a very good environment for growth. The levels of natural growth hormones is highly affected by this, and this is the reason why people call the high-rep range hypertrophy training. It usually takes 3 exercises to train a muscle from all the relevant angles/lengths, so that answers your question I guess."

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes."

All these\"workouts\" may work great things for your health. They will keep your weight in check, improve your balance and range of motion, strengthen your muscles, protect your muscles, stop bladder control issues, and also ward off memory loss.\n \nIndependent of your age or fitness level, these actions are a Few of the very best exercises that you can do and can Help You to Get in shape and Decrease Your risk for disorder:\n \n1. Swimming\nYou may call swimming the ideal workout.\n \nStudies have discovered that swimming may also enhance your mental condition and set you in a much better mood. Water Resistant is another choice.\n \n2. Tai chi\nA combination of movement and comfort is perfect for the mind and body. In reality, Tai chi is a Chinese martial art that has been known as\"meditation in movement.\" Since the courses are offered at different degrees, tai chi is available - and beneficial - for everybody and every age and fitness levels. \"It is especially great for elderly people because equilibrium is a significant part of fitness, and equilibrium is something we lose as we age,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nHave a course that will assist you to get started and find out the appropriate form. It is possible to locate tai chi apps at the regional YMCA, gym, community center, or senior center.\n \n3. Strength training\nLifting light weights will not bulk up your muscles, but it is going to keep them strong. \"If you do not use muscles, then they will lose their power over time,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nComparable to additional exercise, strength training might also help maintain brain function in later decades.\n \nBefore beginning a weight training program, make sure you learn the appropriate form. Start mild, with only a couple of lbs. You ought to be able to lift the weights 10 days easily. After a few weeks, raise this by a pound or 2. If you're able to easily lift the weights through the whole selection of movement over 12 days, then move up to marginally heavier weight.\n \n4. Walking\nWalking is easy yet secure. Additionally, it can help you keep lean, enhance cholesterol levels, fortify bones, and keep blood pressure in check, raise your mood, and decrease your risk for any range of diseases (diabetes and cardiovascular disease, by way of instance ). A variety of studies have revealed that walking and other physical actions can even enhance memory and withstand age-related memory reduction.\n \nAll you will need is a well-fitting and inviting pair of sneakers. Begin with walking for approximately 10 to15 minutes at one time. As time passes, you may begin to walk further and faster, until you are walking for 30 to 60 minutes most days of this week.\n \n5. Kegel exercises\nThese exercises will not allow you to look better. However, they do something equally as significant -- strengthen the pelvic floor muscles which support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles may go a long way toward preventing puberty. When many women are acquainted with Kegels, these exercises may benefit guys also.\n \nSqueeze the muscles you would like to stop yourself from passing gas or urine is the best way to do a Kegel exercise properly. Hold the contraction for a couple of seconds, then release. Be sure that you completely relax your pelvic floor muscles following the decrease. Attempt to perform four to five places every day.\n \nRaking the lawn counts as physical activity. So does ballroom dance and playing with your children or grandkids. Provided that you are doing some aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes each day, and you also comprise two weeks of strength training each week, you may consider yourself a \"busy\" individual."

They just had more \npractice\n.\nSorry\u2026I just love that video.\n \nFull body routine disadvantages\nThey\u2019re \nhard\n. This is BY FAR the main reason people gravitate towards bro splits. Mentally, going into the gym and working your entire body just is on another plane of existence in terms of difficulty compared to just working one chunk of muscle, even if the volume is the same. It\u2019s easy to tap out when you have to do front squats, RDLs, bench press, overhead press, seated rows, pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, extensions and ab wheel all in the same day.\nPerhaps because of this, they can be tough on your \nhormone levels\n. Check the above chart; the full body testosterone went up 11%, but the split went up 21%! Keep in mind this was just four weeks, working out just three times per week, as well. Keeping up a full body protocol all the time, for higher volumes could \nprobably \nlead to reductions in T for some people.\nThey give you \nless time \nto \nrecover\n. This is part of the reason that I really am sure to use a lot of variety in my training when incorporating higher frequency. If you use the same movements all the time, be prepared for your joints to be unhappy. You need to vary the movement patterns enough that it shifts the stress on the joints at least slightly.\nSplit routine advantages\nMore \nrecovery time \nfor each body part between workouts.\nMight have better satellite cell activation (check the answer below) due to the \nincreased concentrated workload \nand greater \nmuscle damage\n. \nGeoffrey Verity Schofield's answer to How fast does lost muscle grow back with muscle memory?\nGet a \nbetter pump\n-doing more work in one session can lead to greater metabolic stress for that muscle.\nCan help you develop a better \nmind-muscle connection. \nYes, that\u2019s a real thing, especially for the upper body.\nCauses increased \nsoreness\n, which can facilitate growth and let you \u201cfeel\u201d that muscle better. This could be a disadvantage if you don\u2019t like this feeling\u2026I personally kinda like it for some twisted reason.\nSplit routine disadvantages\nLower frequency \nper muscle group. This is probably the biggest reason why split routines suck. You do chest on Monday (obviously), and your chest is really only growing for about 36\u201348hours afterwards. There are 168 hours of the week-why would you only have each muscle group growing 20\u201330% of the time? \nNot optimal! \nFull body routines can get that number up to 70\u201380+% for the entire body, which explains the massive difference in both muscle gain and fat loss.\nYou \ncan \nactually \nLOSE muscle\n. In the above example, you\u2019re growing on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. You might be maintaining on Thursday and Friday. But especially if you are cutting or not getting in enough protein, or not sleeping well, it\u2019s entirely possible for the weekend to be in a catabolic state.\nNot that kind of Weaknd; he\u2019s in a catabolic state 24/7\nYou can \nlose \u201ctouch\u201d \nwith an exercise. This isn\u2019t gonna happen with bicep curls or lateral raises, but with something like squatting or Olympic lifting, it\u2019s entirely possible for the nervous system to slightly forget how to do these movements if you\u2019re only doing them once per week.\nAll in all, I\u2019d do full body \nmost \nof the time, but if you hit a plateau, splitting up your routine can be a nice change of pace.\n \nYou\u2019ll have more time to recover, and can really focus on blasting a body part to force it to grow, perhaps through the aforementioned satellite cells. You can recover any hormonal or structural stress incurred during your full body bonanza.\n \nI\u2019ve taken a page out of Eric Helm\u2019s book\nand been doing full body workouts 4\u20136 times a week recently, and it\u2019s been astonishingly effective. Tough\u2026but the gains have been impressive.\n \nBut, I won\u2019t do it for the rest of my life, as it\u2019s not sustainable.\n \nCheck out my new \nSpace\n, \nfollow me on \nInstagram\n \nfor daily diet and training tips!

        "question": "Is a full body workout two or three times a week as effective as a split routine working out 5 or 6 days a week? How do I get the best results possible with the least time invested?",
        "answer": "The effectiveness of a full-body workout versus a split routine largely depends on your fitness goals, experience level, and available time. Here\u2019s a breakdown of both approaches:\n \nFull-Body Workouts (2-3 Times a Week)\n \nPros:\n- \nTime Efficient:\n You can achieve significant results with fewer sessions per week.\n- \nIncreased Frequency:\n Each muscle group is worked multiple times a week, which can enhance muscle growth and strength.\n- \nFlexibility:\n Easier to schedule and can accommodate busy weeks without losing progress.\n- \nCaloric Burn:\n Engaging multiple muscle groups can lead to a higher calorie burn pe\nContinue Reading\nThe effectiveness of a full-body workout versus a split routine largely depends on your fitness goals, experience level, and available time. Here\u2019s a breakdown of both approaches:\n \nFull-Body Workouts (2-3 Times a Week)\n \nPros:\n- \nTime Efficient:\n You can achieve significant results with fewer sessions per week.\n- \nIncreased Frequency:\n Each muscle group is worked multiple times a week, which can enhance muscle growth and strength.\n- \nFlexibility:\n Easier to schedule and can accommodate busy weeks without losing progress.\n- \nCaloric Burn:\n Engaging multiple muscle groups can lead to a higher calorie burn per session.\n \nCons:\n- \nIntensity Management:\n It can be challenging to perform high-intensity workouts for all muscle groups in one session.\n- \nRecovery Needs:\n May require longer recovery time between sessions, especially if workouts are intense.\n \nSplit Routines (5-6 Days a Week)\n \nPros:\n- \nFocused Workouts:\n Allows for higher volume and intensity per muscle group, which can be beneficial for hypertrophy (muscle growth).\n- \nRecovery:\n Muscle groups get more recovery time between workouts, potentially reducing fatigue.\n- \nVariety:\n More exercise variations and techniques can be incorporated.\n \nCons:\n- \nTime Commitment:\n Requires more days in the gym, which may not be feasible for everyone.\n- \nRisk of Imbalance:\n If a session is missed, it might lead to uneven training of muscle groups.\n \nGetting the Best Results with Least Time Invested\nPrioritize Compound Movements:\n Focus on exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench presses, pull-ups). This maximizes efficiency.\nHigh-Intensity Training:\n Incorporate techniques like supersets, circuit training, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to increase the intensity and calorie burn within a shorter time frame.\nProgressive Overload:\n Ensure you are gradually increasing the weight or resistance in your workouts to continue making progress.\nConsistency:\n Stick to a regular workout schedule, whether it\u2019s full-body or split, to maintain progress.\nNutrition and Recovery:\n Pay attention to your diet and recovery strategies, as they are crucial for maximizing results. Ensure adequate protein intake and consider active recovery strategies.\nListen to Your Body:\n Adjust your training volume and intensity based on how your body responds to avoid burnout or injury.\nConclusion\n \nBoth full-body workouts and split routines can be effective, but for minimal time investment, full-body workouts (2-3 times a week) are generally more efficient for most people. However, if you prefer or can commit to a split routine and it fits your goals better, it can also yield excellent results. Ultimately, choose the method that you enjoy and can stick with consistently."

As it is you need first to shock your muscles and then let them rebuild, this takes longer than 24 hours\u201d. He won 6 back to back Mr Olympia titles.\n \nSo my 2 cents is : pretty fast, to get your heart rate up and moderately heavy is the way to go. I'm now 64 and maintaining as much muscle mass is no longer just for asthenics, it's Essential for a a mobile and healthy old age."

For me, a full body workout gives me so much more satisfaction, as I get a feeling of all around tiredness and I feel like I\u2019ve done something good for the whole body. When I do get sore it feels so much more natural. Having only sore arms for example feels kind of weird. I prefer an overall feeling of slight soreness.\n \nMy advice is to just do what feels right to you and keeps you motivated."

Ali has decided to do 8 sets of 3 reps with 250kg (83%) on his main squat day, Monday. He also does front squats on Wednesday, up to 180kg 3x3 and paused squats on Friday, 200kg 5x5.

Ali takes 8 minutes of rest between the work sets, 3 minutes between the lighter warmup sets and 5 between the heavier ones. That\u2019s about 90 minutes of rest total, so we\u2019re looking at close to 2 hours, just for squats.\n \nNow, at this point his focus and attention are beginning to flag, his legs tire and he\u2019s getting hungry. Time to stop. Bench presses will have to wait until Tuesday.\n \nIf you\u2019re not at Ali\u2019s level, there is probably little benefit to splitting up your workout."

However, a common recommendation is to perform a combination of strength training and cardiovascular exercise.\n \nFor gaining muscle and strength, it is important to prioritize resistance training exercises that target all major muscle groups. This can be achieved through either full-body or split routines.\n \nFull-body routines typically involve performing exercises that target multiple muscle groups in each workout session. This can be a good option for beginners or those with limited time to workout. Sample full-body workout routines may include exercises such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows, and overhead press.\n \nSplit routines involve dividing workouts into different muscle groups on different days, typically targeting one or two muscle groups per session. This can be a good option for more advanced lifters or those looking to focus on specific muscle groups. Sample split workout routines may include a push/pull/legs split, where push exercises (e.g. chest, shoulders, triceps) are performed on one day, pull exercises (e.g. back, biceps) on another day, and leg exercises on a separate day.\n \nIn terms of minimizing fat loss, it is important to combine strength training with cardiovascular exercise to create a calorie deficit. Adding in HIIT (high-intensity interval training) or steady-state cardio sessions a few times per week can help to burn additional calories and promote fat loss while maintaining muscle mass."

Olympic lifters and gymnasts do extraordinary amounts of work by layman's standards, and they do them nearly daily and still see improvements. In those cases they don't generally push themselves as hard as a body builder necessarily would (they work themselves 80-90%).\nOver-time your body will adapt to the stresses you put on it, however, metabolic fatigue does build up.  Training too hard, too often can lead to overtraining syndrome,\n[2]\n  where your gains cease and you actually start back sliding. You become moody, you have trouble sleeping, and several other symptoms.\n \nYou don't want to overtrain, but doing the same group twice in a week probably isn't going to cause problems if you program your exercises to the right intensity. Be aware of your body and the signals it's sending you. If you feel exhaused and you're not getting a great workout in consistently, tune it back a bit, otherwise, carry on.\nFootnotes\n[1] \nA series of studies--a practical protocol for testing muscular endurance recovery.\n[2] \nOvertraining Syndrome: A Practical Guide"

You are breaking down a lot of muscle at once and all of it rebuilds at the same time and then you repeat that, you'll gain weight much faster than a split.

I feel the mind-muscle connection can be established in a bro-split routine better than a full body, strength focused routine.\n \nIn my opinion, there are just way too many variables in a bro-split routine to manage, track, and progress. It also requires way too training days to be effective.

It usually takes 3\u20134 training days a week to make excellent progress.\n \nIf you don\u2019t mind spending some money, I would recommend \nBarbell Medicine\n; they have excellent training templates for pretty much any goals that you have.

You pick your first exercise and begin.\n \nBefore you know it, the initial sleepiness has drifted away and been replaced with a fresh dose of energy.\n \nYou get in the zone, start sweating, and feel your heart pounding as you crush your workout.\n \nForty-five minutes later and you are done. You shower and step out of the gym heading for your car. You remember that the rest of the world is just waking up.\nThe sun is peaking out, the birds are stretching their wings, and the air is filled with slightly more activity than when you first got there.\n \nYou drive to work feeling energized, knowing that you\u2019ve already conquered the day and improved yourself.

However, the gym is more crowded at this time of day and you have to strategically pick which exercise to start with.\n \nYou put your headphones in, find an empty machine, and get to work.\n \nThe right song comes on, you start sweating, and you feel your heart pounding as you crush your workout.\n \nAn hour and fifteen minutes later (due to some waiting for machines) you finish up and head for the door. You step out of the gym and head for your car, realizing that the sun is starting to lower on the horizon.\nYou head home feeling pumped that you conquered the day and improved yourself. The day is almost over, but you still have a couple hours to eat, shower, and do whatever you please.\n \nThis, is the feeling of working out in the evening.\nWhich is better?\n \nI can\u2019t make that decision for you.\n \nTest them both out and see what fits your lifestyle.\n \nAt the end of the day, the best time to work out is the one that you actually stick to."

Intervertebral discs are the gel like \u201cspacers\u201d that are found between each of the bones of your spine (aka, vertebrae).\nWhen these discs fill with water, they actually push the bones of the spine (verterbrae) away from each other. This is why you stand slightly taller in the morning, than at night.\n \nSo, first thing in the morning when you get up, these discs are full of water. When you stand up the water starts to run out the discs, and thus you become just a wee-bit shorter.\nOk, but why should I care about water in my discs?\nThe increased water in the discs actually makes the spine stiffer. However, this isn\u2019t a good kind of stiffness.\n \nThis stiffness places a lot of stress on the discs and ligaments vs. the actual soft tissue structures designed to support and protect said discs.\n \nIt takes about an hour of standing for the discs to mostly empty of the water they obtained during sleep.\nSo\u2026can I still workout in the early morning?\nOf course.\n \nBut, if you\u2019re planning to workout within an hour (ish) of getting up you need to be careful about jumping into the following exercises too quickly:\nHeavy back squats or deadlifts \u2192 heavily compresses the spine\nHeavy kettlebell swings \u2192 ballistic hip hinging\nSitups \u2192 flexing your spine through full range of motion\nExcessive bending and twisting movements in general\nBelow are a few good options to get your spine warmed up, before crushing an early morning workout:\nWake up earlier \u2192 gives your spine more time to get back to equilibrium before hitting the gym\nGo for a brisk walk or light jog, before hitting the weights \u2192 moving around helps reduce spine stiffness a little faster\nExtend your warmup \u2192 if you normally warmup for 5\u20138 minutes, extend that out to 12\u201315 minutes.\nBut you didn\u2019t answer the question\u2026Is a morning gym workout \nbetter\n for the health of your spine than an evening gym workout?\nDone correctly, both early morning workouts and evening workouts are fine for your spinal health.\n \nIf you\u2019re working out in the morning, you\u2019ll just need to pay more attention to your preparation before you start crushing heavy weights at the gym.\n \nTrust me, it\u2019s worth paying a little more attention and not just jumping into 1RM deadlifts or squats in the morning, in order to keep your spine injury and pain-free.\n \nAgain, the reason why I\u2019m saying this is that suffering a debilitating back injury really sidelines you, and will make your life absolutely miserable.\n \nTrust me, this happened to me about 12 years ago\u2014back when I was foolishly squatting heavy at 6:30am before classes (and before knowing this information).\nFinal thoughts\nLike I mentioned earlier, this answer can be taken in many different directions. \n\u201cBetter\u201d\n can mean a lot of different things; so I opted to go with what I think is the most important topic to talk about\u2014the health of your spine.\n \nI don\u2019t want this answer to scare you out of working out in the morning, though.\n \nThat\u2019s not my intent.\n \nMy intent is to simply highlight things you need to be aware of, if you are in fact going to workout in the morning.\n \nI hope this answer helps give you a little better idea about keeping your spine healthy during early morning workouts.\nSources for this knowledge\nMost of the knowledge I have learned about spinal mechanics has come from the various work of Dr. Stuart McGill.\n \nDr. McGill is the world\u2019s leading expert in spinal biomechanics. He\u2019s definitely an individual you should listen to regarding spinal health. If you Google his name you\u2019ll find dozens of articles that he\u2019s published about the spine. My suggestion: give a few of them a read."

Pick a time that you can do the most consistently, then worry about 'optimizing' if at all.\nI'm going to address a few fallacies I've skimmed over so far, then I'll get to the meat of my answer in terms of what really matters.\n \n1 - Working out doesn't 'jump-start' your metabolism. Exercise certainly \nadds\n \nadditional energy output\n as it relates to metabolism (See: \nWhat are the best ways to recover or improve my metabolism?\n) but that doesn't mean 'jumpstart.' Being awake in the first place burns more energy, eating a meal burns energy, but they don't 'jumpstart' metabolism either. They just contribute to daily energy expenditure.\n \nThe same amount and type of exercise done at a different part of the day will essentially have the same effect on your metabolism overall.\n \nIt does generally improve mood and energy though. Especially at moderate intensities (aerobic exercise for instance).\n \n2 - Not everybody 'feels' energized \nall day\n from exercising in the morning (\nI certainly don't\n), the boost it provides to energy/mood is usually only as short as a few hours. It also takes roughly 3 hours for body temperature to increase to highly functioning levels anyway, so you might get an endorphin boost until temperature levels hit peak, that carries you through to the early afternoon (\nso a good portion of the day\n) but most people will still experience a lull in early afternoon (1-2 PM-ish), despite exercising in the morning. \n \nYou might actually do better exercising just before lull that to reduce it's impact. And for other reasons I'll get to below...\n \n3 - Exercise does increase memory retention and cognitive function, but these benefits are not limited to a window of 4-10 hours. Exercising in the morning doesn't increase this benefit according to any research I'm familiar with. Furthermore, you wouldn't be wasting those benefits even if there was such a window as most long-term memory retention and cognitive improvement benefits happen during sleep. \n \nRead \nSpark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain\n, but I don't remember it indicating such a window, nor any of the research I read following it up; If anything, closer to exercise would still be better for the several studies done on how subjects perform better on tests done very soon after exercise. The effects on the brain overall however, appear to stick quite well no matter the time.\n \n4 - If you work early in the morning, then it might absolutely be a problem to get up 30-60 minutes before that. I used to start my work day at 6 AM, up at five, technically when I should be in my deepest sleep, now I'm supposed to get up 30-60 before that? So 4-4:30...which means getting to bed at 8-8:30 PM to get eight hours of sleep, which is generally just after when circadian rhythm makes most people the most alert. \n \nFor anyone other than true larks (small percentage of the population), this is a very daunting task. Sure if you start your work day at 9 AM, getting up at 7 to do a quick workout before work might not be so tough and it might often be better for a lot of folks to get it out of the way before their day gets away from them. Mental fatigue from many decisions throughout the day can make it tough to get to the gym after work for A LOT of people, if it isn't already a routine.\n \nHowever, all of this doesn't make it the best or worst time to train, it totally depends on you the person. Your existing routines, your natural circadian rhythm bias (some are larks, some are night owls, most are in between), your work schedule, your family schedule, etc...etc...\nFor more details on how to discover something that works for you then I highly recommend you read these (disclaimer: My Blog...):\n \nHelp! When Should I Train? (Part I) - Skill Based Fitness\n \n \nHelp! When Should I Train? (Part II) - Skill Based Fitness\n \nFirst, generally speaking consistency matters more than anything else. So if you can make yourself more consistent by getting up in the morning and get it out of the way, then sure that would make working out in the morning better...\nfor you...\n \nThis still wouldn't make it better for everyone else.\n \nThat's first and foremost the most important thing; Training at a time that works for you.\n \nIt is easier for a lot of people to skip workouts later in the day and so working out in the morning does often work very well for a lot of people, \nbut physiologically that doesn't make it ideal. \nAnd it doesn't have to be\n immediately\n upon waking either, just enough time to get it done before you get into a lot of cognitive loading work that might later hinder your ability to desire to go to the gym in the first place. It's the same reason productivity gurus tell you to get your most cognitive tasks out of the way early in the day. \n \nActually there may actually be some inherent risks to training within the first 3 hours of waking, particularly if you are say lifting weight or doing explosive work. Less so for endurance/aerobic training.\n \nFrom sleeping all night (horizontal position), the fluid in your spine actually displaces, slightly destabilizing your spine for the first part of the day. This might be associated with injury potential (at least for heavily loaded movements involving the spine). Not only that but nervous system function, muscular blood flow, glucose metabolism and joint mobility at this time of day aren't really that conducive to training.  All of them are limited first in the morning, which is why most world records in sports are not broken first thing in the morning, they are generally broken in early evening.\n \nYou'd be hard pressed to find many strength or power athletes that successfully do the bulk of their training early in the morning (\nsome will start at 10-11 AM\n). There may be some early morning skates, serving practice or shooting practice, but these are usually low intensity and/or optimized to suit the schedules of student-athletes and break up the training day (\nfor twice-a-day training purposes\n).\n \nThis generally doesn't apply as heavily to the endurance athletes, who often have early start times to deal with mid-afternoon heat, but they would probably still perform better if it was done in the early evening (\nit would just be hotter out still in many climates\n). \n \nAgain schedules optimized to the person and the objective, not necessarily the physiological optimized times.\n \nA physiologically optimized (i.e. derive the most benefit from for performance purposes and anabolism) training window for most people (\ndepending on their circadian rhythm\n) is probably anywhere from about 2:30-3 PM in the afternoon (\njust after your circadian dip\n) to about 6:30-7 PM at night. \n \nYes peak circadian rhythm in most people is closer to 8, which is when you might be inclined or think to be ideal. However, training late generally makes it difficult to fall asleep for 2-3 hours post-workout due to hormone fluctuations, so the later in the day you push it the longer you might end staying up. I used to have volleyball practice from 9-11PM in school, and I could never fall asleep before 1AM as a result, which wrecked havoc on my school schedule.\n \nAgain, here \nI am\n speaking from a fairly pure physiological point of view, if you can't do that, or it impedes you from actually training, you're better off doing what makes you the most consistent. The differences are probably physiologically negligible (I'm throwing out a guess of less than 10-15% difference) long-term, except training first thing in the morning is actually pretty terrible for performance purposes (\nwhich isn't necessarily the same as training...\n). It would also probably increase training injury risk slightly for weight training/explosive training. \n \nIt would on the other hand make sense if you competed early in the morning, to move your training to early in the morning to acclimatize for your performances.\n \nTypically if performance is required or the intensity of training is high, wait at least 3 hours, and maybe even preferably six if you can. If it's just aerobic exercise, endurance, then do it whenever is convenient.\n \nThere are other influencers too. For instance if you have a high stress, high cognitive load job (lawyer, doctor, entrepreneur, technician, engineer, etc...) then you might be more likely to skip training the later in the day you leave it. If you have a lower cognitive load job (autopilot repetitive tasks, manual labour, factory work, etc...) then you might have the mental reserve to better tolerate training later in the day.\n \nUltimately, the best time to work out during the day depends on you."

In fact training in a \u201cfasted state\u201d (that means with no food eaten for at least 12 hours or more) is probably the \nmost beneficial for weight loss.\n \nThe body has finite storage capacity and will \nnever use fat while you still have stored glucose energy (glycogen for those that love the science)\n \nIt just would not do that.\n \nIf you are trying to \nbuild muscle while staying lean \nthen you need to keep a close eye on protein. \nHigh protein is pointless \n(unless your are selling protein shakes and bars!) The body can not store excess protein. Again it\u2019s the body having finite storage capacity. Anything over roughly 2 chicken legs worth of protein per meal is simply going be turned to glucose or even worse; fat. \nSo moderate protein intake is required. THERE IS NO BEST TIME TO EAT ONLY BEST TIME TO NOT EAT! \nLeaving at least an hour before and after is best.\n \nSidebar: everyone has heard of human growth hormone, it\u2019s the bodys \u2018repair and rebuild\u2019 hormone. When you wake up HGH is high, and lowers when you start eating. If you buzz to the gym and take some water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt with you then you can workout with the elevated human growth hormone still circulating. The salted water is the best for rehydration.\n \nHydration is often thought of as loss of water, it\u2019s actually loss of electrolytes that\u2019s the issue. Hence the pink salt.\n \nLastly some think water increases metabolic rate. It does, temporarily. But this is only because the body works to bring the temperature of the cold water up to body temperature. If you really want to be geeky about training \nnever drink cold water unless it is to bring your temperature down. It\u2019s a 3% lose of workout energy while it raise the water temperature up.\n \nIt\u2019s really minimal though.\n \nBut to answer your question in a more basic way\n \nThe best time to go is when suits you best. All that above might scientifically help but if you FEEL better at night then you\u2019ll probably get more out of it then dragging yourself there reluctantly in the morning.\n \nIf you don\u2019t mind either then you need to focus on what your goal is.

Furthermore, a full day\u2019s work can take a toll on our willpower, thus deterring us from going to the gym.\nBetter sleep\n: Since exercise increases heart rate and body temperature, working out too late in the evening (generally after 8 p.m.) may disrupt sleep.

This is because early in the morning is usually devoid of sudden commitments. Compare this to afternoon and evening workouts, when responsibilities may arise. Furthermore, a full day\u2019s work can take a toll on our willpower, thus deterring us from going to the gym.\nBetter sleep\n: Since exercise increases heart rate and body temperature, working out too late in the evening (generally after 8 p.m.) may disrupt sleep. On the other hand, one study showed that working out at 7 a.m. (compared to 1 p.m. or 7 p.m.) may help people sleep more soundly at night.\nAvoiding crowds: \nFitness centers see the most traffic between 5 and 8 p.m., making it difficult to get the machine or group fitness class you really want. Mornings see less traffic, making A.M. workouts more efficient. Furthermore, early morning gym-goers tend to get in and get out within a fixed amount of time, leaving no room for socialization and clogging up the gym floor.\nStarting the day right:\n When you start a daily routine with exercise, you are more likely to set yourself up for a healthy domino effect throughout the day. Say, for example, you start the day at the gym. This is often followed by a healthy post-workout shake or snack and an increased water intake all morning long. Getting your workout in the morning makes it easier to incorporate a balanced breakfast into your schedule, setting you up for a day of healthy eating.\nWorking out in the P.M.\nStrength:\n If you are not a morning person, then you will definitely have more strength working out in the afternoon or the evening. After all, if you struggle to wake up in the first place, working out in the morning can result in the inability to concentrate (and injury!), which will decrease workout quality. On the opposite side of the coin, an individual who works out later in the day has the opportunity to eat and fuel his body for a tough workout.\nStress relief: \nMany people see exercise as a way to express their pent up stress throughout the day. Having an outlet, such as a kickboxing or personal training, at the end of the workday can provide a healthy way to release daily stresses.\nAccountability: \nIt\u2019s generally easier to find a workout partner or personal trainer who is willing to meet you for an afternoon or evening workout than one who\u2019s up for a 5 or A.M. weightlifting session.\nAvailability:\n While it is true that avoiding the crowds is a plus for many early morning gym-goers, the exact same reason can be a negative for other individuals. Gyms offer a larger variety of classes after work than in the morning hours. Plus, a packed post-work class may push you to compete against fellow gym-goers and work harder to get the most from your routine.\nWhat about RESULTS?\n \nIn terms of results, current studies suggest that \nworking out in the morning or in the evening can work just as well\n, depending on the individual. \nIt all comes down to workout quality and performance.\n \nAfter all, the advantages of working out in the morning vs evening all comes down to personal preference. \nThe most objective parameter is your individual performance\n. Other than that, no substantial research suggests that one is definitely better than the other.\n \nSo what should you do if you want to workout in the morning?\n \nYou should workout in the morning if:\nYou are a morning person. I.e. you feel energized and fresh enough early in the morning.\nYou feel fine working out in a fasted state. While you can still consume your pre-workout supplement, generally people who work out in the morning opt to have a proper breakfast after their workout session.\nYou should workout in the afternoon or evening if:\nYou are not a morning person.\nYour performance is impaired when training with an empty stomach. Indeed, most individuals find they perform better in the evening because they had a chance to get some meals in earlier in the day.\nDiscovering which one works best for you is easy: try both, and see how your body reacts in comparison. Good luck :D"

Sleep peacefully.\n \nCase 2: \nEvening workout\n \nYou wake up (late, comparatively!), freshen up, have your breakfast and are off to work. You are active as you are usually, with the usual amount of energy amd spark on your face. You come back home, think you have to go to the gym now after such a tiring day.

You come back home, tired as ever with no time and energy left for some other activity.\n \nYou observe the difference up there? I don't feel the need to explain this more.\n \nTalking about the diet plan in the case of morning workout, you have a plus point, that is, you get to intake more amount of healthy food before going to the gym in the morning, which is, an additional meal. After coming back from the gym, have a protein-oriented breakfast, a bit more than your appetite. Have small meals at regular intervals to keep the metabolism rate perfect and immune system active. Eat less in your dinner as compared to your lunch and have it atleast before 2 hours of going to bed.\n \nIf you still have some queries, you can message me anytime and I will revert back to you ASAP.\n \nP.S.: I'm not at all saying that evening workouts are bad or anything against, in fact, when I have to run to work early, I'm left with no other option but to train in evening which is not bad either. All I say is, morning workouts are better than the evening ones.\n \nThanks."

If you exercise late in the night and don't follow that with food, then that highly beneficial period is likely to be wasted.\n \nThat being said, if you can't consistently exercise in the morning, then evening exercise is a good way to go. It would be far more beneficial to consistently exercise in the evening than to do just 1-2 days in the morning and then let go of it."

A longer gap between the last meal and the workout, combined with more available oxygen if the workout is in a ventilated area or outdoors all help burn calories. It's also useful in pumping freshly oxygenated blood to the brain, first thing in the morning and in getting the fitness objective ticked on your checklist.\n \nAn evening workout is useful to build on a somewhat warmed up body and to remove the stress of the day's routine. It takes a different meal time adjustment from the person going for a morning workout. The cool down phase of the workout needs to be longer/slower in an evening workout since the air temperature tends to cool the body faster. (Not applicable if one works out in an air conditioned gym.) This is also useful for those whose routines involve late nights.\n \nAs an aside, the key to waking early is to eat 2 hours or more before hitting bed. Sleeping on a full stomach tends to restrict proper digestion and affects oxidation (burning) of food. This causes reduced oxygen in the blood and the brain suffers from grogginess by the morning."

So some kind of spinal flossing for morning workouts is always a good idea.\n \nAll that being said, the time you can actually train will always work better than the time you can\u2019t.\n \nJust because late afternoon/early evening is the ideal time to express strength as a quality, doesn\u2019t mean a thing if you can\u2019t and don\u2019t train at that time because the time is bad for you.\n \nTraining in the morning gets it out of the way for most people before other aspects of their lives take over and prevent regular training from occurring. Consistency will trump time of day no matter what and many people find morning better for that reason.\n \nThey may never get as \u2018strong\u2019 but rarely is maximum strength really all that important anyway. The average lifter isn\u2019t working towards a world record in anything. For muscle gains, I\u2019m not convinced it matters. You need even more consistency for muscle hypertrophy. I still think you will train better later in the day but that isn\u2019t convenient for a lot of people. So even if you\u2019re 10% stronger at that time, in the grand scheme of things it won\u2019t mean a thing for 95% of the population.\n \nTrain at the time that is most convenient for you because elite athletes don\u2019t ask questions like this on Quora.

It\u2019s often called the stress hormone, but it only causes problems when there\u2019s too much or too little of it.\n \nTypically, cortisol increases in the early morning hours and drops in the evening. It reaches its peak around 8 a.m. If you have a healthy circadian rhythm, your body might be more primed to exercise at this time.\nBetter focus.\nPhysical activity also improves \nfocus and concentration\n, regardless of when you do it. But if you have trouble focusing during the day, a morning workout might be just the ticket.\n \nA 2019 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that morning exercise improves attention, visual learning, and decision-making.\n \nIn the study, participants completed a round of 8-hour days of prolonged sitting with and without a 30-minute morning walk on the treadmill. On some days, they also took 3-minute walking breaks every 30 minutes.\n \nThe days with morning exercise were associated with better cognition throughout the day, especially when paired with regular breaks.\n \nIf a morning workout does not fit into your schedule, make it a point to move actively in the evening!\n \nA well-structured 45-minute fitness routine done four times a day is more than enough to help you seek its benefits."

You could set experience \novertraining syndrome\n, where your body cannot recover enough between workouts.\n \nAdditionally, your body requires a certain amount of time to recover between workouts. If you\u2019re providing enough stimulus to your muscles this is usually between 36 and 48 hours (\ndepending on the muscle worked (muscles like your core tend to recover faster\n), your gender (\nwomen tend to recover faster than men)\n, the intensity that you worked the muscle (\nthe harder you worked it the longer it will take)\n, your age (\nover 60 you will require as much as 96 hours rest to recover between workouts), \nthe nutrition applied, and your hormone profile (\nmore testosterone, HGH, IGF will lead to quicker recovery when coupled with adequate amounts of protein and glucose\n)).\nIf you don\u2019t give it enough time, you won\u2019t build up past your initial baseline, and your muscles will suffer.\n \nAs metabolic fatigue builds up, even in lighter intensity training, you\u2019ll feel it all over. It could be something simple at first \u2014 you stop improving in your lifts, for example. Eventually you start getting worse. Soon you start getting injuries that aren\u2019t healing. You start to feel depressed. Even one day off with complete relaxation or even a light walk could be enough to clear you out, if you catch it early enough. Serious cases of overtraining could require more time.\n \nTo re-iterate:\nIf you don\u2019t work it over 80% intensity every day\nIf you \ndo\n take a break once every 1\u20132 weeks\nYou\u2019ll be fine.\n \nIf you notice things going wrong \u2014 you start feeling weaker, you stop improving, you start feeling like crap in general, you start getting injuries\u2026take a step back. Rest. Recover.\nBrief anecdote as illustration\n \nOnce I was really working my pull ups. I was stuck at 18. I would do them daily, at least 4 sets. I hit 18 every time in my first set, I ended up doing about 50 a day. At first I was gaining daily, I went from 8 to 10 to 14, to 18\u2026but then the growth stopped. I was stuck there for a couple weeks.\n \nI took 2 days off from doing pull ups.\n \nThe next time I stepped up to the bar I did 25 in my first set.\n \nI\u2019m not saying that you\u2019ll have dramatic results like this, but sometimes the missing part of your workout is actually \nnot\n working out."

Simple, economy. Working out more than 3-4 times a week doesn't contribute to the economy. You can't draw more people to go to the gym, buy apparel or supplements if you promote daily exercise. You don't spend more money working out than hanging out elsewhere. So you will not only be told that you can achieve your dream body just working 2-3 hours a week, but also that your body cannot handle much more. Besides, gym time is still considered a waste, \u201cwhy\u201d they will tell you, \u201cwaste 6-7 days a week at the gym when you could exercise less and enjoy life more?\u201c Browsing on social media 3 hours a day is considered more normal. It has nothing to do with sports science, it is ideology.\n \nTell me which one is more taxing on the body: Lifting weights where you spend more than 2/3 of your time resting, or an NBA game? Athletes play up to 4 games a week, plus training, you think you cannot handle doing flys, curls, pulldowns, and basic human movements everyday? In all other sports, lifting weights is the supplement to the main sport, and the average gym goer believes s/he has to have full 3-4 rest days a week to maximize benefits and train hard, how pathetic is that? I know those other guys are athletes, it's their job, etc. But we are talking about the capacities of the human body. You can improve your work load capacity. I'm not saying that everyone can or should be an athlete, but an hour of training a day is nowhere close to an athlete's schedule. Athletes typically have up to 15 sessions a week, each around 2.5 hours. Ask olympic weightlifters and they will tell you. Even some bodybuilders, like Jay Cutler, have been known to train twice a day. One of the most respected academicians in sports science, Mike Israetel, also says you can train more than 7 times a week if you have the time and proper schedule that allows for it. Several months ago, he had three sessions a day himself. \u201cRecovery,\u201d in other words, can be handled pretty well.\n \nAnd now people will pull the \u201cnatural\u201d card. It is actually the natural lifters who should train as often as possible to increase protein synthesis. You could get away with training each bodypart once a week if you were on steroids, but that's not the case if you are natural. Keep the sessions short and intense, stimulate your muscles and don't annihilate your joints, so you can train the same muscle group as often as possible. That will give you enough weekly volume to grow.\n \nAnd certain muscle groups can be trained almost everyday. Posture muscles (abs, traps), smaller muscles that won't tax your entire body and do not get heavily involved in big compounds (side/rear delts, calves, biceps) can be trained almost everyday. Bigger muscles can be trained 2-4 times a week. If you schedule smartly, it is perfectly fine.\n \nHere\n is a good example by Christian Thibaudeau. It is 6 days a week, but you get the idea."

The best I ever got was after working in Slovakia for a few months, where I only trained at weekends. I returned to Thailand and subsequently won my 1st race back.\n \nWell that turned out to be my only 1st place - although I still got the occasional podium after resuming overtraining.\n \nI stopped racing and started back in the gym about 5 years ago. Every other day, I gradually improved but never got near to where I was before.\n \nAlmost 3 years ago I had a change of circumstances and now train at most 5 times a fortnight- and often only have time twice a week.\n \nI can't squat shit anymore, or bench press nearly as much either but on curls I'm only about 10kg off my best- and my best was 25 years ago!\n \nDorian Yates famously said : \u201c If training 10 hours a day and eating dog shit was the way to be a winner, I'd have done it. As it is you need first to shock your muscles and then let them rebuild, this takes longer than 24 hours\u201d.

Sign me up!\nMore frequent \npractice \nwith the movements-that could explain why the bench results were very similar above (simple movement) but the full body group got better squat gains (more complex movement). They just had more \npractice\n.\nSorry\u2026I just love that video.\n \nFull body routine disadvantages\nThey\u2019re \nhard\n. This is BY FAR the main reason people gravitate towards bro splits. Mentally, going into the gym and working your entire body just is on another plane of existence in terms of difficulty compared to just working one chunk of muscle, even if the volume is the same. It\u2019s easy to tap out when you have to do front squats, RDLs, bench press, overhead press, seated rows, pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, extensions and ab wheel all in the same day.\nPerhaps because of this, they can be tough on your \nhormone levels\n. Check the above chart; the full body testosterone went up 11%, but the split went up 21%! Keep in mind this was just four weeks, working out just three times per week, as well. Keeping up a full body protocol all the time, for higher volumes could \nprobably \nlead to reductions in T for some people.\nThey give you \nless time \nto \nrecover\n. This is part of the reason that I really am sure to use a lot of variety in my training when incorporating higher frequency. If you use the same movements all the time, be prepared for your joints to be unhappy. You need to vary the movement patterns enough that it shifts the stress on the joints at least slightly.\nSplit routine advantages\nMore \nrecovery time \nfor each body part between workouts.\nMight have better satellite cell activation (check the answer below) due to the \nincreased concentrated workload \nand greater \nmuscle damage\n. \nGeoffrey Verity Schofield's answer to How fast does lost muscle grow back with muscle memory?\nGet a \nbetter pump\n-doing more work in one session can lead to greater metabolic stress for that muscle.\nCan help you develop a better \nmind-muscle connection. \nYes, that\u2019s a real thing, especially for the upper body.\nCauses increased \nsoreness\n, which can facilitate growth and let you \u201cfeel\u201d that muscle better. This could be a disadvantage if you don\u2019t like this feeling\u2026I personally kinda like it for some twisted reason.\nSplit routine disadvantages\nLower frequency \nper muscle group. This is probably the biggest reason why split routines suck. You do chest on Monday (obviously), and your chest is really only growing for about 36\u201348hours afterwards. There are 168 hours of the week-why would you only have each muscle group growing 20\u201330% of the time? \nNot optimal! \nFull body routines can get that number up to 70\u201380+% for the entire body, which explains the massive difference in both muscle gain and fat loss.\nYou \ncan \nactually \nLOSE muscle\n. In the above example, you\u2019re growing on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. You might be maintaining on Thursday and Friday. But especially if you are cutting or not getting in enough protein, or not sleeping well, it\u2019s entirely possible for the weekend to be in a catabolic state.\nNot that kind of Weaknd; he\u2019s in a catabolic state 24/7\nYou can \nlose \u201ctouch\u201d \nwith an exercise. This isn\u2019t gonna happen with bicep curls or lateral raises, but with something like squatting or Olympic lifting, it\u2019s entirely possible for the nervous system to slightly forget how to do these movements if you\u2019re only doing them once per week.\nAll in all, I\u2019d do full body \nmost \nof the time, but if you hit a plateau, splitting up your routine can be a nice change of pace.\n \nYou\u2019ll have more time to recover, and can really focus on blasting a body part to force it to grow, perhaps through the aforementioned satellite cells. You can recover any hormonal or structural stress incurred during your full body bonanza.\n \nI\u2019ve taken a page out of Eric Helm\u2019s book\nand been doing full body workouts 4\u20136 times a week recently, and it\u2019s been astonishingly effective. Tough\u2026but the gains have been impressive.\n \nBut, I won\u2019t do it for the rest of my life, as it\u2019s not sustainable.\n \nCheck out my new \nSpace\n, \nfollow me on \nInstagram\n \nfor daily diet and training tips!

        "question": "Is it bad to do full body workouts every day?",
        "answer": "How do you get the best results possible with the least time invested?\n \nFull-body workouts.\nIf you are a beginner do them twice per week, and if you are intermediate or advance then you can do them three times per week.\n \nI would also add in that another great option for advanced trainers is a 4-day upper lower split. But that is for people with especially good recovery abilities.\n \nIt amazes me how much the bodybuilding industry has confused the shit out of people. Telling them to workout 6 times per week, eat 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and other useless nonsense. Sure that works for the guys taking steroids, but all it does for a natural trainer is lead them nowhere. Yeah, you might experience results in a few months, but after that you\u2019ll stagnate.\n \nFull-body workouts on the other hand, are the perfect routines for natural trainers. They offer enough volume, but not too much to where you can\u2019t recover from. In addition, you\u2019re joints and central nervous system get more of a break and time to recover because you\u2019re not training as often.\n \nAll you need in a full-body workout is a major push, a major pull, and a major legs exercise. The intermediate and advance could also benefit from some assistance exercises for the arms and calves. But other than that, this is all you will ever need to grow. I currently am 6\u20321 and weigh 203 lbs, at 11 percent body fat. And I have been on a maintenance routine only lifting weights twice per week and sprinting on a third day. I haven\u2019t gained any mass (hence the maintenance routine) but I still have continued to gain strength. One of my example workouts was this:\n \nWeighted Dips: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nWeighted Chin-ups: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nSquats: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nCalf raises and forearms: 2\u20133 sets of 10\u201315 reps\n \nWill you get to be 250 at 5 % body fat and become some absolute beast?? Hell no, not even close. But no natural trainer will ever get that close. If you are around 6 feet tall, the most you can ever expect to weight at 10 percent body fat is probably 215 to 220. And those numbers are for someone with very great genetics.\n \nI love how people think they need to follow the split routines 6 days per week because everyone else is doing it.\n \nWell, how many people do you see that are big and strong? Not many. How many people do you see at the gym following those splits who are actually big and NOT taking steroids? Probably zero.\n \nI talk about this in great detail in my book which you can find here: \nBasic But Brutal"

I have equipment at home. I would work my arms when I got up. Get out of bed start with a set of curls. My theory was that by doing enough to get a pump in the morning, when I came home from work, later at the gym and a few sets to get a blood flush in my arms just before bed. Keeping the blood in the tissue was the goal. I had spectacular results in less than 3 months. I gained over an inch a month on my arms.\n \nI did this in the mid eighties. I ate food that I purchased at the grocery stores and restaurants. I took vitamin supplements. Knox Gelatin and cod liver oil protected my joints.\n \nI lifted heavy, three sets trying for four strict reps and then cheating for the next four but resisting and slowing the eccentric part of the movement which should always be done with a full range of motion, working the eccentric part of the rep to shape the muscles.\n \nWhile the pro bodybuilders at that time were eating jars of baby food while working out I found something better. I didn\u2019t know it at that time either but today it is known through science that when a bodybuilder completes his workout the best way to increase the cells absorption of the post workout protein is for the bodybuilder to eat two slices of white bread or a cup of white rice. The simple sugars in the refined grain tempts the cells to open taking in more of the protein maximizing muscle growth.\n \nIn the afternoon when I returned home from work I would have a snack of peanuts and fresh squeezed cider while doing some arm exercises. The peanuts supplied fat, protein and so many vitamins and minerals as well as arginine. A cup of peanuts has more than 3X the arginine as a most whey servings supplying 40 grams of protein. The natural sugar in the cider opened up the cells sucking in the nutrients while the arginine dilates the cardiovascular system. Before going to bed I would maybe 6 ounces of peanuts and have a glass of apple juice while doing enough arm exercises to get the pump back in.\n \nI was really doing a full workout in the morning, a teaser when I got home from work, a full workout at the gym, and enough to flush and pump my arms just before bed. I ate yogurt, steak, eggs, sardines, baked potatoes, salads, cooked vegetables, whole grain breads, almonds, walnuts, I ate humongous amounts of foods but when I started eating the peanuts and drinking the cider I found the gains in strength and size came much more quickly."

Otherwise you\u2019d be playing the same guys on the same level and that shit would get old real quick because there was no challenge.\n \nThat\u2019s kinda how your workout is. If you\u2019re doing the same reps with the same weight, eventually your body is going to get bored because there is no challenge. It already built up the muscle and strength needed to lift that weight.\n \nThere\u2019s no reason for your body to progress because it can handle the stress you are giving it through your workout.\n \nJust like the video games you enjoyed, you need to hit the next level to see results.\n \nLEVERS OF PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD\nWhen it comes to progressive overload there are a few levers you can adjust to increase the challenge.\n \nWeight\n: Arguably the most used and abuse lever. The concept is simple, add more weight to the bar.\n \nReps\n: Increase the number of reps you can lift a certain weight for.\n \nSets\n: Increase the number of sets per exercise.\n \nTime Under Tension\n: Increase the time your muscles need to support the weight.\n \nRest Periods\n: Decreasing the time between sets.\n \nTraining Frequency\n: Adding another day of hitting a muscle group without being debilitatingly sore.\n \nEach week work one of these levers to add progressive overload to your muscles.\n \nBut this is when it starts getting hairy because a haphazard approach could lead to gainz in the short term. Unfortunately, muscle isn\u2019t built in the short term, it\u2019s a long term project so you\u2019ll need a plan.\n \nTHE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD METHOD\nThere\u2019s a few different methods for ensuring progressive overload in your workouts. The most basic one is called a Single Progression method.\n \nSingle (or Linear) Progression Method:\n Basically each workout you increase the weight on a lift.\n \nLet\u2019s say you can bench 225 for 8 reps.\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 230 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 3: 235 for 8 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nOn paper this is pretty sweet. But for anyone that has ever lifted a weight ever, you know damn well shit doesn\u2019t go that smoothly.\n \nEventually, you\u2019ll hit a point where you can\u2019t get 8 reps with good form. You\u2019ll get 5 solid reps and 3 cockeyed-am-I-gonna-die reps.\n \nSide Note: IMO this is a piss-poor way to progress. It\u2019s very short sighted.\n \nDouble Progression Method:\n In this method you increase reps first then weight.\n \nSay you can bench 225 lbs for 8 reps.\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 225 for 9 reps\n \nWeek 3: 225 for 10 reps\n \nWeek 4: 235 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 5: 235 for 9 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nI like this method much better than the Single Progression because it allows you to get stronger and \u201cmilk\u201d the results from a certain weight.\n \nFor this, I like to work in rep brackets rather than just a target number of reps per set. Instead of saying 3 sets of 10 reps, I would give my clients something like 3 sets of 8-10 reps or change the desired reps in each workout within that bracket.\nThis way you have a range to progress and you know where the ceiling is to increase the weight. Once you hit the top of the range on all your sets, drop the reps to the bottom of the bracket and increase the weight.\n \nThis is the best for busy individuals with time restriction to their workouts. It takes an extra min to add another rep to each set.\n \nTriple Progression Method: \nIn this method you first increase the reps, then sets and finally weight.\n \nBringing back our benching example:\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 3 sets of 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 225 for 3 sets of 9 reps\n \nWeek 3: 225 for 3 sets of 10 reps\n \nWeek 4: 225 for 4 sets of 8 reps\n \nWeek 5: 225 for 4 sets of 9 reps\n \nWeek 6: 225 for 4 sets of 10 reps\n \nWeek 7: 235 for 3 sets of 8 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nFor this method I would still keep the rep bracket and only increase 1 set before increasing the weight. Depending on how many exercises you do this on, you can easily add another 10-15 mins to your workout.\n \nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU USE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD\n \nThe first week of a new workout is the feeling out process.\n \nFinding the right weight for each exercise, how the exercise sequence flows with the flow of everyone else in the gym (i.e. are you waiting on equipment) and learning the right form for new exercises.\n \nLet\u2019s assume we are using a double progression method here.\n \nSo for week 1, I always tell my clients do the workout as-is and pick a weight where you get close to failure at the lower end of a rep bracket.\n \nIn week 2 you\u2019ll know what to expect and we can start pushing a little more. Try increasing reps on all sets.\n \nWeek 3 through whenever: Once you can hit the top of the rep bracket on all the sets. Increase the weight and drop the reps back down.\n \nNow if you change your workout every 4 weeks you probably won\u2019t be able to see the increase in weight right away. Odds are you\u2019ll still be trying to increase the reps by the end of the fourth week.\n \nWhich is fine. It\u2019s still progressive overload and you\u2019re still getting closer to your goal.\n \nIf you like your workout, stick to it. There\u2019s no harm in going 6-7-8 weeks with one workout program. If anything you\u2019ll get really good at those particular lifts and not to \nmention stronger\n.\n \nAfter about 12 weeks or so, I would say you need to switch the exercises up a little just because you\u2019ll be building weaknesses in the areas that aren\u2019t the focus of your particular workout. Plus, if you\u2019re doing something like heavy squatting for 12 consecutive weeks your hips and knees will need a break.\n \nWILL YOU PROGRESS EVERY WEEK?\n \nAbsolutely not.\n \nSome workouts are just going to suck.\n \nOthers are going to be a cake walk.\n \nThe fact of the matter is that you have a lot of shit going on in your life which can drain some gym energy. The important thing is to try to do more each week.\n \nSometimes you\u2019ll get there. And the more and more you advance into your weight lifting career the harder it is to make progress.\n \nIf you\u2019re a gym noob, I would expect week over week improvement for the first 6 months or so.\n \nIf you\u2019re a little more advanced I would expect every couple of weeks you\u2019ll see in increase.\n \nIf you\u2019re\n advanced\n, first off I have zero idea why you\u2019d be reading this, but anyways\u2026If you\u2019re advanced once every couple of months seeing an increase.\n \nAnd that is progressive overload. Now go build some muscles.\n \nAesthetic Physiques"

Cholesterade is an all natural and great tasting soluble fiber supplement with 7g of fiber per serving. Increasing the fiber will not only clean you out, but it will lower your cholesterol, lower your blood sugar, normalize your blood pressure and will give you more of a full feeling at meal time which will allow you to eat less, thus creating healthy weight loss. Give it a shot for 8 weeks as recommended and see the results for yourself. Best of Luck !!!"

This addiction started at the age of 13 when my father bought me my first weight set. I am currently 21 years old. In the 8 years that I have spent training, I've read dozens of books regarding training, read and watched thousands of videos in that time aswell.\nHere an some interesting facts about myself:\n \nI\u2019ve performed over a million push-ups in my life.\nBack to your question about two days a week full body workout. Here's a excerpt from the book \nDinosaur Training: LOST SECRETS OF STRENGTH AND DEVELOPMENT.\nDinosaur training sessions are short, hard and infrequent. A typical session will consist of no more than twenty sets, with at least half of those sets being progressively heavier warm-ups. The average number of sets per workout would be between eight and fifteen. Some sessions will consist of only four or five sets. A typical week will see the dinosaur training only two or three times. That means the dinosaur trains his entire body with well under fifty sets PER WEEK. It also means the dinosaur will spend no more than three hours per week on his training. I refer to this type of training as abbreviated training.\n \nThere are two basic ways to implement abbreviated training. One way is to work the entire body in each workout. For example, you might train on Monday and Thursday. On Monday you would do squats, benches, pulldowns and seated military presses. On Thursday you would do HAMMER STRENGTH leg presses, stiff legged deadlifts, chins, dips and standing curls with a barbell. Thus, you are doing a total body workout every time you train, but you are doing different movements in each session and only working each particular exercise one time per week.\n \nThe second way to implement abbreviated training is to train each basic exercise only one time per week. and do only two or three basic exercises per session. For example, you might do squats and benches on Monday, followed by presses, pulldowns and dips on Wednesday, followed by deadlifts or cleans, shrugs and barrel lifting on Friday.\n \nIn either approach, the sets, reps and exercises are up to the discretion and personal preference of the lifter. Either system allows you to do high rep death marches with a heavy poundage ... to do five sets of five reps ... to do heavy singles ... to do rack work or anything else that strikes your fancy.\n \nIf you prefer to get more rest between training sessions, schedule your program over a ten day or two week period. For example, take two workouts over a ten day period instead of two workouts over a seven day period. Or train three times in two weeks rather than three times in one week. The variations are endless.\nJust to make things easier for you, here's a great schedule:\n \nDAY ONE\n (sets x reps)\n \n1. Squat 4x5\n 2. Standing Press 4x5\n 3. Bent-over Barbell Row 4x5\n 4. Farmer's Walk (one time)\n 5. Bent-legged situps 2x8-15\n 6. Auxiliary work for neck, biceps or calves (optional)\n \nDAY TWO\n \n1. Bent-legged Deadlift, Stiff-legged Deadlift, Power Clean, Power Pull, or Power Snatch 4 x 5 (or 5 x 3 for cleans, pulls or snatches)\n 2. Bench Press (barbell or dumbbell) (or floor press) 4x5\n 3. Sandbag Walk (one time)\n \n4. Side-bends 2x8-15\n 5. Auxiliary work as on Day One (optional)\n \nSounds simple, doesn't it? That's because it IS simple. Hard? Just try it.\n \nPerseverance, patience and determination will be repaid in untold wealth, health, strength, self-reliance and fortitude. \nGeorge F. Jowett"

        "answer": "The most effective workout routine for building muscle mass follows a simple formula.\n \nCompound Workouts + Calorie Surplus + Recovery = Muscle Mass.\n Each part of this equation will need equal attention if your aim is to pack on muscle in the most efficient way possible. There are many ways to the top of the mountain but this method has worked for me over the past 15 years strength training whilst working full-time at a desk job.\n \nCompound Workouts\n \nI choose the bang-for-your buck compounds like squats, deadlifts, bench press and bent over rows. Spreading this out intelligently throughout the week will allow my muscles to recovery, adapt and ultimately grow. As I\u2019m in the office 3 days a week (with access to a gym) my current routine is as follows:\n \nDay 1:\n \nBarbell Bench Press 12/10/8/8\n \nDB Flys 12/12/12\n \nBarbell Rows 12/10/8/8\n \nLat Pull Down 12/12/12\n \nBarbell Military Press 12/10/8/8\n \nBarbell Upright Rows 12/12/12\n \nDay 2:\n \nBarbell Squat 12/10/8/8\n \nBarbell Lunge 12/12/12\n \nDeadlift 12/10/8/6\n \nSmith Machine Calf Raise 15/15/15\n \nDay 3:\n \nIncline Dumbell Chest Press 12/12/12\n \nClose Grip Pull Downs 12/12/12\n \nSeat Arnold Press 12/12/12\n \nCable Curls/Tricep Pull Downs Superset 12/12/12/12\n \nLying Leg Raises x20\n \nAngels & Devils 1 min\n \nThings to keep in mind when executing the workout:\nAlways control the weight (do not let the weight control you)\nThink about what muscles are contracting and focus your power there\nAlways have a tight core with each movement - this creates a stable base for each exercise and reduces risk of injury\nRest 60\u201390 seconds between each set\nCalorie Surplus\n \nYou will need to consume more calories than you are burning to build muscle (the opposite is true if you want to shed some weight).\n \nThere is a bit of work upfront as you\u2019ll need to find your baseline and track how much food you are eating. A good starting point are the numerous BMR calculators available (I use the MyFitnessPal one) and then adjust based on the amount of activity you undertake during the day (I use my smart watch to give me guides).\n \nWhen I first started I was surprised at how much more I actually needed to eat to exceed the calories I was burning. Adding a protein shake between meals has helped get these numbers up.\n \nRecovery\n \nThe final ingredient and arguably the most important.\n \nIf you don\u2019t let your muscles (and body) recover then it will not be able to adapt to the stimulus your workout has provided. Muscles grow when you rest so recover harder than you train. Prioritise your sleep and make sure you listen to your body\u2019s needs.\n \nWhen your body is recovered your workouts can be executed with a greater intensity and that will ultimately be the most effective if you want to build muscle.\n \nSO\n\u2026the most effective workout routine to build muscle incorporates:\nCompound Lifts executed 3 days a week\nCalorie Surplus - fueling your body more than it burns\nRecover - give time for your muscles to grow\nI hope that helps.

        "question": "Is it good to do weightlifting every day?",
        "answer": "No, it is generally not recommended to do weightlifting every day. Muscles need time to rest and recover between weightlifting sessions in order to grow and become stronger. Typical recommendations are to allow 1-2 days of rest between strength training sessions for the same muscle groups. Doing weightlifting every day can lead to overtraining, increased risk of injury, and plateaus in strength gains. A well-designed weightlifting program incorporates planned rest and recovery days to allow the body to adapt and improve."

I knew I was somewhat overweight, but I have lost over 20 pounds, while putting on at least 8-10 pounds of muscle \u2013 \u2013 which means I lost close to 30 pounds of fat. It's remarkable how much fat can hide internally (especially in men) in the abdomen!\n \nI watched the clock turn back.\n \nIt's not just that I am stronger and better built \u2013 \u2013 my skin tone/elasticity is noticeably better, my mood is brighter, my energy level is much greater \u2013 \u2013 my general sense of well-being and \u2013 \u2013 \"alive-ness\" \u2014 feels like I have returned to my 40s.\n \nThere is more and more evidence that intelligent weightlifting \u2013 \u2013 consistent, and intense enough to be genuinely challenging \u2013 \u2013 can not only retard the aging process, but to some degree, reverse it.\n \nThat has certainly been my experience. Of course, my stamina is not what it was 30 years ago, and 45/50 minutes of intense work is my limit, unless I push so hard that I stop looking forward to workouts \u2013 \u2013 and run the risk of losing focus toward the end \u2013 \u2013 which is when you inevitably hurt yourself.\n \nSo I do one body part a day \u2014 actually, I divide legs up, and do some legwork on three of those days to make it less brutal \u2013 \u2013 and I continue to make real progress, look forward to my workouts, and I do not in anyway feel I am over-training.\n \nI think every-day is pushing it. But you can definitely do more than three days a week, if you want to \u2014 if you do it intelligently, find what works for you (for me, it is weights heavy enough that I am limited to 6\u20138 reps per set in most cases), and FOCUS INTENTLY ON EVERY REP TO AVOID INJURY.\n \nMy experience is that five days a week is healthy, fun, and productive. And if you stick with it and push yourself just enough \u2013 \u2013 the results can be nothing short of magical."

I rocked my hips back and dropped into my form, feeling totally in control. On the way back up, I got stuck. I leaned forward and the bar spilled over my neck. More than 500 pounds went violently crashing to the floor and members of both teams turned to look.\n \nLuckily, nothing was injured that day other than my pride.  It could have been much worse.  I was over-trained; I had an intense weight training session the day before and was just coming off playing nine innings.  \u201cMore is better\u201d was my mantra, but I was na\u00efve.\n \nAt 23, I lifted heavy weights every day. Now, I lift three days a week. I\u2019m not quite as strong, but I\u2019m inching closer to that 500 pound threshold now that I understand the importance of rest and recovery.  If I understood how the body repairs itself when I was a rookie, I would have been stronger, healthier, and a better baseball player.\n \nIt\u2019s essential to incorporate recovery days into your program so your muscles can adequately repair themselves, grow and become stronger. When we train with weights, we actually create small tears in our muscle fibers. Those fibers then repair and rebuild bigger and stronger while we rest.  If you don\u2019t build in that downtime, you break the muscle fibers down further reducing the chance for solid growth and increasing the risk of injury.\n \nIf your ultimate goal is size and strength, avoid weight training, even targeting separate muscle groups, on consecutive days.\n \nYour body only builds muscle when you are not weight training.  Trust the process, believe in the value of rest, and you\u2019ll be significantly stronger as a result."

Each milestone (10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 100, 200, 300, 365 days) gives a huge mental boost. The first 100 are the hardest, but then it feels easy.\nWho You Run With: \nNever run alone. If you are not running with a friend or a run club, listen to your favorite artist for motivation. Create a Spotify playlist that makes you want to dance. Runners and Artists give you energy.\nWhat to Prep: \nSet your shoes and clothes out the night before your run. If you run in the morning, set it in your room so you see it right when you wake up. If you run at night, pack your clothes and shoes the day before in a gym bag.\nWhere to Run\n: Create a portfolio of your favorite routes near your home or work. Where have you already been training? You know these tracks, trails and streets like your own home, so you are confident going into these runs.\nWhen to Run\n: Run at the same time everyday. Block out the time on your schedule when it is the best time for you to run. The more consistent you are, the easier this gets. If your health is a priority, do it first thing in the morning every day after waking up so there are no excuses.\nListen to your Body\n: You will know your body better than anyone if you built a base first. Recovery is key. If you aren\u2019t recovering between runs, then walk. Go back to the foundations. Easy days, healthy nutrition, and adequate sleep are the foundation.\nWhy Do You Run\n: There will be days that are going to be hard. Shitty weather. Low energy. Always remember why you started and who you are running for. We get to run."

I started low, maybe 15lbs (Iol don\u2019t judge me) and gradually got up to 40lbs, then 45lbs and so on. I\u2019ve been working out mainly from home the last 5 months and I\u2019ve been in really good shape. I am not as disciplined as other fitness freaks but I still try to work out at least 3 times a week, 45 minutes each session. Some months when I\u2019m really disciplined, I can really trace my abs and definition. Right now, I\u2019ve lost some definition and muscle mass because full-time summer classes and work is stressing me out. I haven\u2019t been as dedicated.\n \nWhat worked for me was basically adding resistance and weights to my training and workouts. It did wonders in building my body strength, and strengthened major muscles of my body like my glutes. Weight training also increased my body weight by about 5lbs. That is an extremely good thing because I have actually gained muscle (which weighs more) and lost some fat. For reference, I use a body caliper I bought from amazon to measure this.\n \nWomen have a weird resistance to weight training, I promise you won\u2019t look manly or hulk-out if you pick up that 20lb weight. You will have to work your ass off to get to that low body fat percentage and ripped. I personally don\u2019t have the discipline for that.\n \nThis is me in 2020, satisfied but still a long way to go from the perfect physique."

I love running too and he showed me it is possible. So, I told myself: \"One day, every day\"\n \nCautionary Tale from my First Attempt:\n \nThe first time I tried to streak was back in May 2020. Covid-19 shut down all the gyms, so \nrunning was my routine.\n I was doing well until Day 59 of the streak.\n \nThat morning, I remember \nfeeling physically and mentally exhausted\n before going out the run. My fatigue usually goes away after the first two miles, so I thought I would be good.\n \nI was running a different route through my city and side-stepped onto the gravel. My shoe kept sliding right over the gravel and I felt a pop. My ankle turned into a balloon!\n \nI could have avoided this misstep if I listened to my body. I was out for a few weeks after that.\n \nAnd so it goes.\n \nWhy I tried again:\n \nI have a strong motivation to \nmake fitness an unbreakable habit\n. After a few months of not being consistent with exercise, I was tired of making excuses. I decided to run first thing every morning before work.\n \nI asked myself three questions:\nWhy do I want to do this?\n Running is my favorite thing to do. The rush I get after a run helps me get through my day. The days when I wouldn't run I felt off mentally. I want to share that it is possible and inspire people to find a fitness habit that they love to do every day too.\nHow do I know I can do this?\n I had already been running for a long time. I have a base level of fitness. Covid-19 let me focus more on running and working remotely gave me more time. All I needed to do was balance harder runs with mostly easy recovery runs each week.\nWhat is my minimum?\n One mile a day. Even if I'm traveling or off the routine, I know I can fit one mile in. Make it easy.\nTips that worked for me:\nBuild a foundation \nof easy running over months or years before you start a run streak and keep easy days easy!\nThe first 100 days are the challenge\n. Each milestone (30, 60, 90, 100, 200, 300, 365 days) gives a huge mental boost to keep going. After 100, it becomes less physical and more mental.\nFollow Hellah Sedibe and thousands of runners\n who have been running every day (check out the 4000+ runners streaking on \nruneveryday\n Some have been doing it for 50+ years).\nIt feels good to start the day with a run.

Also training this longer leads to central nervous system fatigue, which affects the intensity of training and intensity is one of the major contributors to hypertrophy. Also training muscle groups like triceps with the same intensity after doing bench press is difficult because intensity is compromised due to the onset of peripheral fatigue at this point. So, my advice to you- follow full body workouts only in cases you want to build foundational strength as in beginners. A full body workout for an intermediate is inferior in terms of hypertrophy."

        "question": "What are the pros and cons of training full-body every day?",
        "answer": "The issue is that if you train your full body to your maximum effort every day, you won\u2019t be able to recover properly and suffer from over training and will actually make less progress.\n \nThis is why it is recommended to split your exercises and focus on different muscle groups everyday so that whilst you workout one set of muscle groups, the others get a chance to recover which is important for growth."

Advanced athletes will also need to include many isolation exercises.\n \n3: Even after warm-up, it takes at least 2 sets to get a grasp of the technique and make the most out of an exercise. A higher frequency training means a lower number of sets per session which won\u2019t allow performing more than 2\u20133 sets for an exercise. This is why advanced athletes train with a lower frequency, less number of exercises, and a higher number of sets per session. Less warmup and more exercise.\n \n4: Too much fatigue will accumulate due to training every single day. This might not be a concern for beginners but it will affect advanced athletes. It's better to train full body 3\u20136 times per week and adjust rest days accordingly.\n \nFull-body workouts are undoubtedly effective but doing them every single day is not.\n \nSubscribe to \nBrawny King Fitness\n for legit fitness videos."

Second of all you won\u2019t necessarily be able to focus on specific muscle groups like for example a push, pull, legs split offers training chest, triceps, and shoulders for a push day.

They allow you to get into neutral grips more easily (which also tend to be nicer on the shoulders).\nThey allow you to train rotational patterns with greater ease (there are landmine exercises you can do with a barbell that are rotational, and you can off-set the loads of barbell to make them more rotationally demanding though)\nBodyweight on it's own often isn't enough because it's a fixed load, once you've adapted to the load you can only do more repetitions (i.e. you can increase endurance but not really strength at that point). Dumbbells will allow you to train closed and open chain movements too.\nDumbbells often let you train with a more natural arc/position\nCons:\n \nBarbells let you lift more (which is more important for lower rep, higher intensity lifting) - especially for the major bilateral lifts (you will generally always be able to bench press, squat and deadlift more with a barbell than dumbbells)\nBarbells are less grip intensive. Dumbbells require more grip strength (which isn't necessarily a bad thing - it just creates a limiting factor if you want to train strength/power more completely)\nBarbells generally allow for better mechanical loading changes with lower body training. i.e. the difference between a back squat (try putting some DB's on your shoulders to see what I mean), a front squat, an overhead squat, and a zercher squat all lead to good training outcomes when used with some variety.\nBarbells allow you to alter grip positions differently by leveraging torque (narrow grip bench vs medium grip or wide grip - can yield different training results you won't be able to get with dumbbells).\nKettlebells provide a better grip challenge than dumbbells and are more suited for exercises like the swing\nKettlebells provide a higher proprioceptive stimulus, particularly for explosive lifts\nBands provide a unique stimulus that is generally hardest where people are their strongest (Dumbbells like Barbells are a more fixed weight relative to the human strength curve)\nSleds allow you to more adequately train concentric only patterns, which can be great for not making you too sore between more dynamic lift days and still getting a training effect.\nI could probably go on. At the end of the day I think having access to a variety of stimulus is ideal, however, you can still get a lot done with dumbbells and bodyweight if that's your only existing option."

When I start to feel a little bit of generalized fatigue and weakness (signs of over training) I just take a day off without changing anything in my diet.\n \nThe VAST majority of the time that you hear people talk about over training, they aren\u2019t really describing over training, they\u2019re just describing being weak willed. Genuine over training IS a thing but it\u2019s hard to get there unless you work out like a fiend and don\u2019t eat/sleep enough.\n \nThat said, not everybody has the same goals or even the desire to be in the gym as much as me. This is totally understandable. So if you WANT to go to the gym seven days a week, go for it\u2026get a split that makes sense and make sure you eat/sleep enough.\n \nI also highly recommend a joint supplement if you\u2019re going to train this much. I train with something called Texas Method where I alternate heavy weight days with hypertrophy (8\u201312 reps) days. A joint supplement is helpful to ward off some of the inflammation that comes naturally with weight lifting"

I opted to go with a push-pull-legs split - I figured I could at least get three days in. Ideally, it would have looked like this:\nBut a funny thing happened: if I had any kind of conflict at all, I skipped leg day. Board meeting runs late? Skip leg day. Get in an argument with my girlfriend? Skip leg day. Looks like rain outside? You get the idea. No excuse was too trivial.\n \nEventually, I realized that \u201cleg day\u201d - devoting an entire workout session to some of the most taxing exercises you can do - was psychologically overwhelming. So I moved to total body because it ensured that I worked legs and worked with my schedule. Yes, I still had to do squats and deadlifts, but 1) I didn\u2019t have to do them on the same day and 2) I got to follow them up with what I like to call \u201cdessert\u201d exercises - curls, triceps pushdowns, etc.\n \nHowever, just because total body works for me doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best option for you. You know your schedule better than I do.

Sign me up!\nMore frequent \npractice \nwith the movements-that could explain why the bench results were very similar above (simple movement) but the full body group got better squat gains (more complex movement). They just had more \npractice\n.\nSorry\u2026I just love that video.\n \nFull body routine disadvantages\nThey\u2019re \nhard\n. This is BY FAR the main reason people gravitate towards bro splits. Mentally, going into the gym and working your entire body just is on another plane of existence in terms of difficulty compared to just working one chunk of muscle, even if the volume is the same. It\u2019s easy to tap out when you have to do front squats, RDLs, bench press, overhead press, seated rows, pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, extensions and ab wheel all in the same day.\nPerhaps because of this, they can be tough on your \nhormone levels\n. Check the above chart; the full body testosterone went up 11%, but the split went up 21%! Keep in mind this was just four weeks, working out just three times per week, as well. Keeping up a full body protocol all the time, for higher volumes could \nprobably \nlead to reductions in T for some people.\nThey give you \nless time \nto \nrecover\n. This is part of the reason that I really am sure to use a lot of variety in my training when incorporating higher frequency. If you use the same movements all the time, be prepared for your joints to be unhappy. You need to vary the movement patterns enough that it shifts the stress on the joints at least slightly.\nSplit routine advantages\nMore \nrecovery time \nfor each body part between workouts.\nMight have better satellite cell activation (check the answer below) due to the \nincreased concentrated workload \nand greater \nmuscle damage\n. \nGeoffrey Verity Schofield's answer to How fast does lost muscle grow back with muscle memory?\nGet a \nbetter pump\n-doing more work in one session can lead to greater metabolic stress for that muscle.\nCan help you develop a better \nmind-muscle connection. \nYes, that\u2019s a real thing, especially for the upper body.\nCauses increased \nsoreness\n, which can facilitate growth and let you \u201cfeel\u201d that muscle better. This could be a disadvantage if you don\u2019t like this feeling\u2026I personally kinda like it for some twisted reason.\nSplit routine disadvantages\nLower frequency \nper muscle group. This is probably the biggest reason why split routines suck. You do chest on Monday (obviously), and your chest is really only growing for about 36\u201348hours afterwards. There are 168 hours of the week-why would you only have each muscle group growing 20\u201330% of the time? \nNot optimal! \nFull body routines can get that number up to 70\u201380+% for the entire body, which explains the massive difference in both muscle gain and fat loss.\nYou \ncan \nactually \nLOSE muscle\n. In the above example, you\u2019re growing on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. You might be maintaining on Thursday and Friday. But especially if you are cutting or not getting in enough protein, or not sleeping well, it\u2019s entirely possible for the weekend to be in a catabolic state.\nNot that kind of Weaknd; he\u2019s in a catabolic state 24/7\nYou can \nlose \u201ctouch\u201d \nwith an exercise. This isn\u2019t gonna happen with bicep curls or lateral raises, but with something like squatting or Olympic lifting, it\u2019s entirely possible for the nervous system to slightly forget how to do these movements if you\u2019re only doing them once per week.\nAll in all, I\u2019d do full body \nmost \nof the time, but if you hit a plateau, splitting up your routine can be a nice change of pace.\n \nYou\u2019ll have more time to recover, and can really focus on blasting a body part to force it to grow, perhaps through the aforementioned satellite cells. You can recover any hormonal or structural stress incurred during your full body bonanza.\n \nI\u2019ve taken a page out of Eric Helm\u2019s book\nand been doing full body workouts 4\u20136 times a week recently, and it\u2019s been astonishingly effective.

Engaging in daily workouts can also contribute to weight loss or weight maintenance, depending on your goals.\n \nExercise has been shown to have positive effects on mental health. Regular physical activity can reduce stress, improve mood, boost self-confidence, and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Consistent exercise can also improve your overall energy levels and stamina. Over time, your body becomes accustomed to physical exertion, and you may find that you have more energy throughout the day.\n \nIt's important to listen to your body, vary your workouts, and prioritize rest and recovery days to avoid overexertion and maintain a healthy balance. Consulting with a fitness professional or personal trainer can help you develop a safe and effective workout plan based on your goals and fitness level."

It will likely feel more fulfilling because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression BH reducing levels of stress hormones like Cortisol and Arsenal.\n \nOf course , all of those benefits depends on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week.\n \nA balanced diet is also Paramount to a healthy lifestyle.\n \nFor the average adult ages 18 to 64 , the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of 2.5 hours per week of moderately intense exercise like brisk walking or biking.\nOr, at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high intensity workouts like Running or Swimming sprints.\n \nOn top of that, make sure and take 2 days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training.\n \nThis will help your overall speed and endurance .\n \nAs you begin. Its important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast or you risk serious injury.\nYou will discover that the fitter you become, the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week, the week after, and so forth.\n \nExercise smart and often. And you will be running marathon in no time.\n \nIf you want to see few of my great answers on Quora like:\n \nHow to Lose weight without doing exercise?\nWhat are the best ways to lose weight?"

Sometimes I used even to combine running, bicycle tours (65km) and swimming(2km) altogether in one day.

Training your muscles in this way will shape them and make them generally stronger, but training isn\u2019t all about strength and endurance. It\u2019s also about function, coordination and multi-joint activation. Isometric exercise won\u2019t make you much more functional per se.\n \nHowever since you asked only about getting muscles the answer is yes it is possible to get toned and strong muscles without any resistance training."

        "answer": "That\u2019s a great question.\n \nFirst of all, 10 kg isn\u2019t light. You can achieve just about anything with the weight of your own body. But, sometimes it\u2019s hard without equipment and dumbbells are a great choice.

Here\u2019s an answer where I go in depth about this:\n \nLazar Nikolic's answer to What is the best way to build muscles at home?\n \nFirst of all, if you don\u2019t have a\n pull-up bar\n, these dumbbells might come in handy \u2013 curl variations (for biceps), \nContinue Reading\nThat\u2019s a great question.\n \nFirst of all, 10 kg isn\u2019t light. You can achieve just about anything with the weight of your own body. But, sometimes it\u2019s hard without equipment and dumbbells are a great choice. They are versatile and even portable.\n \nSo, let\u2019s get into it.\n \nIn order to shorten this answer and not repeat myself, I won\u2019t write about basic bodyweight training. Here\u2019s an answer where I go in depth about this:\n \nLazar Nikolic's answer to What is the best way to build muscles at home?\n \nFirst of all, if you don\u2019t have a\n pull-up bar\n, these dumbbells might come in handy \u2013 curl variations (for biceps), dumbbell rows (narrow for lats, wider for rear delts) etc. But I highly suggest you try to save up for a pull-up bar, or at least find one in your neighborhood. Or use something else that\u2019s strong enough for you to hold onto. Pull-ups are one of the staples of bodyweight training.\n \nThis leads us to another point from the previous answer: muscles you can\u2019t easily target without equipment. \nCalves\n, for example, are used to the weight of your body, but using 20 kg of dumbbells as a resistance just might create initial overload. Don\u2019t try to exercise your \nmiddle delts\n with these, though. I\u2019m almost certain you won\u2019t be able to handle so much weight in a side lateral raise.\n \nBut, the beauty of dumbbells is this \u2013 you can make any exercise harder or easier with these. Let\u2019s take this paragraph from the linked answer:\nMix push-ups and dips for the chest, front shoulders and triceps\nMix pull-ups and chin-ups for lats, biceps, rear delts and the upper back\nMix variations of leg raises, planks and crunches for abs and obliques\nDo lower back extensions for the lower back (spinal erectors)\nMix hip thrusts and glute bridges for the gluteus\nMix squats and lunges for quads\nYou can put a dumbbell (or both) in a backpack and create more tension on \ndips\n, \npush-ups \nor a \nplank\n. You can use one or both in \nsquats\n and \nlunges\n easily. You can make both \nhip thrusts\n and \nglute bridges\n harder with dumbbell(s). And you can hold one or both while doing \ncrunches \nor even hold one of them between legs in \npull-ups\n and\n leg raises\n when you get strong enough.\n \nBut making things harder is in perspective, first you need to create a strong base and develop proper form if you intend on adding weight. That\u2019s where we start looking at things from a different perspective.\n \nIf \npush-ups\n are too hard, use dumbbells to do a \ndumbbell bench press\n. You don\u2019t even need a bench, lay on the floor.\n \nHandstand push-ups\n are one of the best shoulder building exercises. But that\u2019s way too hard, even for more experienced individuals. So, how to get there? Well, you can go through push-up progressions, but you can also strengthen these muscles doing \ndumbbell overhead press\n. In the beginning, use only one dumbbell and switch to both when you develop adequate strength. Just make sure you are familiar with proper form.\n \nIn the beginning, you probably won\u2019t be able to \ncurl \n10 kg effectively either. So, again \u2013 use only one dumbbell. If that\u2019s the case, that is.\n \nSo, in short \u2013 if you pair your two dumbbells with bodyweight training, you can definitely build more than enough muscle.\n \nI suggest you head off to \nAthlean-X\n YouTube channel and learn proper form of any exercise you want to do. You can also find great insight on \nCalisthenic Movement\n and\n FitnessFAQs\n YouTube channels.\n \nLearn new variations, both easier and harder, if you want to have a good, stable base for future training. Develop your whole body and stretch, so you don\u2019t injure yourself.\n \nDon\u2019t chase numbers, do your absolute best on every exercise and you\u2019ll have results. Just make sure that you can safely do anything you set your mind to. Again \u2013 \nstudy proper form in detail before attempting anything\n.\n \nGood luck!\n \nEDIT\n: In some other answers, people said that these dumbbells will eventually get too light for you. That certainly is true. But, with good \nbodyweight variations\n, you can mitigate this \u201cproblem\u201d. You can also change the way you move them in space \u2013\n slow down\n, do \none and a half rep\n style training, do \n21's technique\n and more. Yes, expanding your equipment inventory would be beneficial, but that\u2019s so far ahead of you that you don\u2019t have to worry about that now. Cheers!"

        "answer": "Basically, laborers work out all day long. Depending on the kind of labor, just like the kind of workout, they will have varying amounts of strength and muscular endurance. Eventually, you would adapt. You would be tired at the end of the day and would accumulate fatigue over the week if you worked out every day, but you would eventually recover more quickly, maybe in a day or two. You would become strong and be able to work harder longer, but you would not likely develop your potential peak strength or hypertrophy."

Some variation in exercises does help to hit the muscle group from different angles, perhaps work different muscles within the group with different emphasis and so on, but that just means you do a few different versions of each movement over time.\n \nPersonally, I find the basics still work. Squats, presses, deadlifts, rows. My routine is built around that. I do variations like front squats, step-ups, hack squats, sumo and stiff-legged deadlifts, one-arm pulldowns instead of pull-ups sometimes, kettlebell rows or T-bar rows\u2026 but the core of the workout remains the same. Of course, I\u2019m at an age and lifestyle where continuous progress is not even the goal - I\u2019m happy to stay at the same weight / shape / strength levels while being able to eat normally and have a few drinks over the course of the week.\n \nApart from anything else, those 4 moves are so fundamental to training that you really need to groove them - and then keep practicing them. So for the first few years of training, always do them. After that, if you want a few different workouts over the course of the week that\u2019s fine, but still squat, row and press at least once a week (deadlifts once a week is fine from the beginning - many people don\u2019t recover fast enough to be able to do more).\n \nSo, find the best moves, keep them at the core of your routine, put in a few variations from time to time and do it for the next few decades\u2026 unless you\u2019re entering this year\u2019s Mr. Olympia or World\u2019s Strongest Man in which case you shouldn\u2019t be on this forum for advice."

They still squat, press and pull 3\u20137 days a week.\n \nWhat is the problem with split training routines?\n \nLet\u2019s look at the concept. Basically the idea is that you train a body part, say legs. once a week, completely into the ground, you \u201cdestroy\u201d, \u201cdemolish\u201d, \u201cannihilate\u201d your legs, then rest for a week.\n \nNow, both research and experience has shown that first, most drug-free trainees cannot recover properly from such an extreme training session and that milder sessions spread out over the week work better and second, that the muscle building period after training in drug-free people is only 1\u20132 days and that they are then ready to train again.\n \nIn other words, you get much better results, at any stage of advancement, from squatting 3 sets Monday, 3 sets Wednesday and 3 sets Friday, than from squatting 9 sets Monday and resting for a week.\n \nNot only that, but you avoid the crippling soreness that you get from once-a-week training and feel fresher and stronger all the time.\n \nYes, advanced trainees sometimes train for 5\u201310 sessions a week and then incorporate some sort of split, but they still work each basic movement several times during the week.\n \nWhole-body does not imply that each session needs to be exactly the same. I keep them similar for total beginners. Repetition and practice in the base lifts is crucial. But for intermediates and above it is feasible and useful to vary the sessions, both the set/rep scheme and the exercise."

Today, there are just as many frustrated lifters as there were 20 years ago, when gym rats spent 20 hours per week or more in their local box.\n \nMost\n bodybuilders hit plateaus, no matter how often they lift, because they don't want to change their routine\u2014comfort quickly leads to fewer gains.\n \nUsing an old pre-season football strategy of two-a-day workouts\u2014literally lifting twice in one day\u2014is a great way to mix up your routine, giving you better muscle and strength gains while helping to slash body fat.\n \nAnd no, you don't have to be in the NFL to do two-a-days!\n \nThis approach is great for anybody looking to make awesome gains on a tight schedule because, as it turns out, two 30-minute workouts are actually more productive than one 60-minute workout.\n \nAdvantages Of Two-A-Days\n \nOne of the greatest benefits of doing two-a-days lies in the obvious\u2014you're working out twice in one day and, hopefully, you're also eating two post - workout meals!\n \nBy working out twice, you get your protein synthesis and other anabolic systems racing. If you take full advantage of this by having two post-workout meals, you can start to see your gains skyrocket.\n \nYou will also find yourself able to train with more intensity.\n \nWhen faced with a full hour's worth of exercise, most of us subconsciously conserve our energy early on, so we don't find ourselves dragging through the latter portion of the workout. By splitting the total day's training between two sessions, intensity levels start and finish higher, which is key to new strength and muscle gains!\n \nAnd since you're fully ramped up for each workout, you'll burn more total calories than if the whole workout had been done at the same time.\n \nThe greater calorie deficit will offset the extra food being eaten, and the overall affect is more muscle with more fat burn\n \nHow To Do Two-A-Day Workouts\n \nTwo-A-Day Basics\n \nSome basic rules apply to all two-a-day programs.\n \nWhile you don't have to be exact with the timing, you need to allow at least six hours between the two workouts. If your workouts are much closer than this, you'll be too tired for optimal performance during round two.\n \nBecause of this, most people find it easiest to hit the gym in the morning before work and then catch another session after work. Going on your lunch break and then again in the evening also works well, as long as you've waited at least six hours.\n \nYou also have to make sure you limit your workouts to no more than 40 minutes in length, excluding the warm-up.\n \nAnd yes, it is very important for you to perform a proper warm-up and cool-down to speed up recovery, since you'll be back in the gym before the day is over!\n \nThe light, rhythmic exercise you get with a proper cool-down, such as 5-10 minutes of an easy aerobic activity like running, will help the heart to return the pooled blood trapped in the pumped-up muscles, speed up the removal of lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, and allow the muscles to lengthen again after the chronic contractions of a good lifting session.\n \nYou'll quickly get tired of two-a-days if you're constantly fatigued, so a quick and efficient recovery is the key to this program's success.\n \nTwo-A-Days Should Be Cycled\n \nSimply doing two random workouts in one day will quickly lead to overtraining and burnout. There's a proper way to structure your program so that you meet the increased energy demands and take full advantage of this unique fat-burning and muscle-building opportunity.\n \nDue to the intensity of training, these programs are best saved for busting through plateaus, or for those times when you're extremely motivated to work out and the idea of going to the gym that much sounds appealing.\n \nTo avoid overtraining, two-a-days should be cycled\u2014two weeks on, one week off\u2014or you'll burn out and, alas, plateau\u2014the very thing you'd hoped to overcome.\n \nTreat the two-a-day regime with respect, and it will respect you back!\n \nDesigning A Two-A-Day Program\n \nWhile there are plenty of ways to design your program, one of the most effective is lifting heavy in the first workout, then lighter in the second.\n \nThis lets you train your high-threshold muscle fibers\u2014the ones with the most strength and growth potential\u2014with a short, tough workout in the morning, while fitting in an evening workout that's easier but longer."

You will increase repetations eventually with time .\nWeight exercises : If you have weights, biceps curls and shoulder press exercises are adviced . Weight training is important part of workout routine but it optional in the start and you can include it in your routine in future.\nImportant Tips :\nDon\u2019t include too much exercises in the start. More than one exercise for single body part won't make that muscle making process shorter but will exhaust your energy and time.\nStart from your efficiency with less exercises in beginning and increase repetitions and exercises with time.\nDon't think about the result , Trust the process!!!. Enjoy workout routine and only include exercise that you like. (For beginners) . (We don't want our body to get tired early of the routine.)\nYou don't need protein powder or any extra supplement apart from the daily food you get. Just eat much you want but there should be 4\u20135 hours at least gap between workout time and food time. Eat any junk food much you want but remember once in a month, don't eat on regular basis . It makes you lazy .\nMost important thing is \u201cRest\u201d. Do take 8 hours sleep at least . Do Workout 4 days a week . Remember your don't get muscle in workout time but it builds muscle when you sleeping.\nStart today, be consistent.

Workout on that for a week or 2 and learn the basic movements, how to push the weights in order to target the right muscle and to which extent in order to avoid injury. Second machine would be a pectoral fly machine. Use both these muscles under the supervision of a trainer and learn about the proper movements before using the barbells/dumbbells for dumbbell press (substitution for chest-press machine) and dumbbell fly (for pectoral fly machine)\n \n2)BACK (2nd major muscle)\n \nBe very cautious while doing back exercises as even a small injury in your lower back can cause physical problems for you for many years. Be cautious about your posture while doing any back exercise which means standing straight (or knees bent in some exercises) and contracting your traps while pushing your chest outwards and keeping your lower back straight by pushing your hips outwards (in exercises in which you are supposed to bend your knees). THIS APPLIES TO EVERY BACK EXERCISE.\n \nAs on first day, do lat pull down, seated rowing, dumbbell shrugs and bent over rowing.\n \n3)LEGS (The 3rd major muscle)\n \nDon\u2019t go heavy on squats for the first month if you\u2019re starting gym for the first time in life. Do body-weight squats or simply barbell squats (without lading the weights) to learn to balance and get your leg muscles working. Use leg-press machines and leg extensions to workout your quadriceps and leg curl and seated calf raises to workout your hamstrings and calves respectively for first few weeks.\n \n4)Shoulders\n \nInstead of doing lifting exercises, do raising ones like dumbbell front raise, lateral raise, bent over lateral raise.\n \n5) Arms (Biceps and Triceps)\n \nThere is not really much to pay attention while working out your arms except for the posture while doing biceps dumbbell/barbell curl \u2018coz people tend to use a jerk while lifting which leads to bending the waist backwards which in some cases results very dangerous if the weight is heavy.\n \nHope it helps..Happy gyming.."

If you cannot manage the push-ups, then drop your knees to the ground and push from there. Another starting progression if you cannot complete a \u201cfull\u201d push-up is to just focus on doing the downward part of the movement - usually, you will reach a point where you end up just flopping down the rest of the way\u2026 try to avoid banging your nose on the floor, it will hurt\u2026 but if you put as much effort into the downward part as you can and get as low as you can on every rep, and then finish with the flop every rep, and just reset back to the top of the movement, you will eventually manage to get all the way down without flopping. Then you just have to do the push, which will be hard, but give it 100% and then stop and reset as needed.\n \nNext, bodyweight squats. Sit on a kitchen chair, or the toilet, or a comfortable chair if you really want to. Without using your arms, lean forward and stand up. Once you are fully upright, sit back down again but do not let your weight sink into the chair - just sit down until you feel contact between your body and the material of the seat. Now stand up again. Remember, no hands! Also, your feet should not move at all. Repeat for 10 reps per set, 3 sets.\n \nLunges - from a standing position, take a step forward with one foot. Drive your front knee forward and bend it, until your hip is as close to the heel of your front foot as you can manage, ideally with your rear leg being straight. Now move back up to your starting position and repeat the motion with the other leg. Repeat 10 times per set, for 3 sets.\n \nAs a beginner workout routine, that would usually be enough to start with."

If you can already do 3 x 20 or 3 x 25, do that instead. I am doing 3 x 50, trying to get to 4 x 50.\nBodyweight squats - I know, bodyweight for anything isn\u2019t as flashy as \u201cLiFtInG mAd WeIgHtS bRo\u201d but bodyweight squats, when done for high reps, will help strengthen and tone your quads which will then help when you actually perform squats with a higher weight. I personally do 3 x 40 for these but I\u2019d start at 3 x 20 or 3 x 25 for someone just starting.\nCalf Raises - These can be done with bodyweight, dumbbells, or the machine at the gym. All 3 work great and unless you\u2019re a neanderthal and don\u2019t stretch beforehand, you shouldn\u2019t get hurt doing these. These help with strengthening your calves (no shit) which will help with running for athletes and overall, aesthetically, I have had my calves commented on just as much as my upper body. I do 3 x 15 for these on the machine, but I load up the weight to 290 lbs. For bodyweight, I do around 3 x 30.\nBench Press - Bench press is probably the most common staple of any chest workout and for good reason. It not only helps with delivering a good pump to the pecs but it also seems to help with filling out the shoulders which for a lot of skinny guys working out is a huge plus. Dumbbells are great to start with as they teach balance and force you to use your pecs and not just your triceps and forearms to lift them. I do either 2 x 8 for this with 225 lbs or 3 x 12 with 165 pounds. I would start with a basic 3 x 10 with whatever weight you can do safely as a beginner.\nDeadlifts - Holy shit start light with this. People watch strongmen deadlift 1,000 pounds and they're like \u201cOh if they can do that then 300 is a breeze for me\u201d. THAT IS THE WRONG APPROACH TO ANY WORKOUT LET ALONE ONE THAT CAN REALLY FUCK YOU UP IF YOU DO IT WRONG! This strengthens your back, core, quads, and triceps among many other muscles when done right. I do this 3 x 5 with 405 pounds. I have been doing these for 5 years though and have built up to that. Start at 135 pounds and do high reps to get your form down. There is no shame in doing these, or frankly any workout, with a coach or trainer to get your form down. Safety is more important than \u201cMaD gAiNz BrO\u201d.\nThis is not a definitive list and I am not a medical doctor or professional trainer. This is how I was trained for lacrosse and it has worked pretty well for me functionally and aesthetically ever since. Granted there are other workouts like curls that I mostly do to have some \u201cflashy\u201d muscle but otherwise, my workout is based around cardio endurance, strength, and being able to react quickly (which is more of a stretching thing but that\u2019s a different topic for another time).\n \nFirst and foremost, workout to be healthy. Don\u2019t try to be a pro bodybuilder unless you understand what it takes. By that I mean, are you willing to do steroids? Are you willing to eat waaaayyyyyy too much protein than is healthy? Are you willing to give up hours upon hours of time chasing a fleeting feeling that will never satisfy you even if you are the best in the world? If you can answer all of those with yes honestly the fine, you know the risks and that\u2019s that.\n \n(BTW not knocking bodybuilders at all. Half of my lifting buddies are bodybuilders and they are some of the coolest people I know. It takes years of hard work, even with steroids, to get to that level. I can\u2019t do bodybuilding because of my health as I already have high Test levels and I really don\u2019t want to fuck with that. Also, my family is predisposed for heart complications and I have no desire to die at the age of 45 as my mom did from a heart attack).\n \nHope this helps,\n \nBen"

I could get to the gym five days a week because it was right there on campus; I had nothing else to worry about aside from classes.\n \nI took about a decade off from the gym (let\u2019s say from 2009 to 2017) and when I found my way back, I was thirty with a full-time job - I didn\u2019t have the same amount of time to play with. I opted to go with a push-pull-legs split - I figured I could at least get three days in. Ideally, it would have looked like this:\nBut a funny thing happened: if I had any kind of conflict at all, I skipped leg day. Board meeting runs late? Skip leg day. Get in an argument with my girlfriend? Skip leg day. Looks like rain outside? You get the idea. No excuse was too trivial.\n \nEventually, I realized that \u201cleg day\u201d - devoting an entire workout session to some of the most taxing exercises you can do - was psychologically overwhelming. So I moved to total body because it ensured that I worked legs and worked with my schedule. Yes, I still had to do squats and deadlifts, but 1) I didn\u2019t have to do them on the same day and 2) I got to follow them up with what I like to call \u201cdessert\u201d exercises - curls, triceps pushdowns, etc.\n \nHowever, just because total body works for me doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best option for you. You know your schedule better than I do. And, more importantly, you know yourself - your tendencies, your weak areas, etc. Take all of that knowledge into consideration and then choose the option that works best for you."

Then I\u2019ll rest for 45\u201360sec. Only to start the next set.\n \nTrust me, your heart rate will jack the heck up on this routine!\n \nYou don\u2019t have to run any additional cardio with this and you\u2019ll develop a very \u201cfunctional\u201d type of strength endurance if you stick to it.\n \nOh, and you\u2019ll also build some lean muscle!

Regardless of the objective worth of the routine, make sure that:\nyou get something done, even if it\u2019s not perfect or it\u2019s not everything you planned\nyou have fun doing it (that way it\u2019s easier to stay consistent)\nyou stay safe while doing it (do the stuff you know, and ask for help for the stuff you don\u2019t know)\nyou leave something in the tank so you can come back tomorrow and do something (that way it\u2019s easier to stay consistent)\nyou STOP IMMEDIATELY if something seems off, such as pain, nausea, dizziness, breathlessness, etc. Always listen to your body. A certain degree of soreness in the muscles is inevitable when we move in ways that we\u2019re not used to, but it shouldn\u2019t be crippling (that means you\u2019ve overdone it). But any other kind of pain, especially in your joints, or any of the other things I mentioned, are red flags\nThat said, here are some more specific suggestions.\nMake sure your routine has a strength component. Do this 2\u20133 times a week, on non-consecutive days.\nMake sure your routine has an endurance component. Do this 3\u20135 times a week.\nMake sure you keep your joints mobile. Do this almost everyday; think of it like \u2018brushing your teeth\u2019, but for your joints.\nSTRENGTH\n \nFor each of the categories below, pick an exercise which is moderately challenging (not too hard and not too easy). Accumulate 15 - 30 total repetitions per session for each category. Split them up any way you like. If you feel like the exercise in a particular category goes from \u2018moderately challenging\u2019 to \u2018easy\u2019, pick a harder version of the exercise, go back down to the lower end of that repetition range, and build your way up to the higher end. Then rinse and repeat. Be patient and do this over months, not days. That\u2019s how you stay safe. Sometimes, to make an exercise harder, you\u2019ll need to add more weight. Be creative and use household objects.\nPushing (push up variations)\nPulling (dead hang, pull up variations, rowing variations)\nSquatting (squat/lunge etc)\nENDURANCE\n \nPick an activity you enjoy (e.g. walking/hiking/running/swimming/cycling/dancing etc) - it doesn\u2019t matter what you pick. You can switch it up session to session, or not, as you like - it doesn\u2019t matter. Do it steadily for 20\u201330 minutes. Do it at a difficulty level where you can speak 5\u20136 words at a time before needing to take a breath (but if you can speak 15\u201320 words, you need to step it up).\n \nOnce you\u2019re used to the activity, increase the duration of one session a week to 45 minutes, while the other sessions remain 20\u201330 minutes. Eventually increase the long session close to 60 minutes.\n \nJOINT MOBILITY\n \nLook at every joint in your body - neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, spine, hips, knees and ankles. Each of them can move in certain ways. Some joints, such as the neck, spine, hips, and shoulders, can move more freely than the others. Throughout the day, take little breaks of a minute or two, and keep moving the joints in all the ways they CAN move. Keep it super easy, but do it a bunch of times. Don\u2019t sweat if you can\u2019t move EVERY joint EVERY day, just make sure no joint gets ignored for too long. Easy-peasy.\n \nHope you find this helpful. It looks simple, but the power is in DOING, not in KNOWING. If you\u2019re a beginner and you keep this up for a few months, your health, energy, and overall sense of well-being are bound to improve. Good luck!"

But that is for people with especially good recovery abilities.\n \nIt amazes me how much the bodybuilding industry has confused the shit out of people. Telling them to workout 6 times per week, eat 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and other useless nonsense. Sure that works for the guys taking steroids, but all it does for a natural trainer is lead them nowhere. Yeah, you might experience results in a few months, but after that you\u2019ll stagnate.\n \nFull-body workouts on the other hand, are the perfect routines for natural trainers. They offer enough volume, but not too much to where you can\u2019t recover from. In addition, you\u2019re joints and central nervous system get more of a break and time to recover because you\u2019re not training as often.\n \nAll you need in a full-body workout is a major push, a major pull, and a major legs exercise. The intermediate and advance could also benefit from some assistance exercises for the arms and calves. But other than that, this is all you will ever need to grow. I currently am 6\u20321 and weigh 203 lbs, at 11 percent body fat. And I have been on a maintenance routine only lifting weights twice per week and sprinting on a third day. I haven\u2019t gained any mass (hence the maintenance routine) but I still have continued to gain strength. One of my example workouts was this:\n \nWeighted Dips: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nWeighted Chin-ups: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nSquats: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nCalf raises and forearms: 2\u20133 sets of 10\u201315 reps\n \nWill you get to be 250 at 5 % body fat and become some absolute beast?? Hell no, not even close. But no natural trainer will ever get that close. If you are around 6 feet tall, the most you can ever expect to weight at 10 percent body fat is probably 215 to 220. And those numbers are for someone with very great genetics.\n \nI love how people think they need to follow the split routines 6 days per week because everyone else is doing it.\n \nWell, how many people do you see that are big and strong? Not many. How many people do you see at the gym following those splits who are actually big and NOT taking steroids? Probably zero.\n \nI talk about this in great detail in my book which you can find here: \nBasic But Brutal"

It should focus on building a foundation of strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness while avoiding overwhelming the newcomer. Here's a well-rounded workout routine for beginners:\n \nWarm-up (5-10 minutes):\n \nStart with a light cardiovascular activity like brisk walking, jogging, or cycling to increase blood flow and warm up your muscles. Follow it with some dynamic stretches to improve flexibility and mobility.\n \nStrength Training (2-3 times a week):\n \nFocus on full-body workouts that target major muscle groups. Here's a sample routine:\n \nSquats:\n 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions\n \nPush-ups (can be modified): 2 sets of 8-10 repetitions\n \nDumbbell lunges: 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions per leg\n \nDumbbell shoulder press: 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions\n \nBent-over dumbbell rows: 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions\n \nPlanks:\n 2 sets, holding for 30-60 seconds each\n \nStart with lighter weights and progress gradually as you get comfortable with the exercises.\n \nCardiovascular Exercise (3-4 times a week):\n \nChoose activities you enjoy, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, or dancing. Aim for 20-30 minutes per session, gradually increasing the duration as your fitness level improves.\n \nFlexibility and Cool Down (5-10 minutes):\n \nStretch your major muscle groups, holding each stretch for 15-30 seconds. This will improve flexibility and help prevent injury. Focus on areas like hamstrings, quadriceps, chest, shoulders, and calves.\n \nRest and Recovery:\n \nAllow your body to rest and recover between workouts. Beginners should aim for at least one or two days of rest per week. Listen to your body and adjust the intensity or frequency of workouts if needed.\n \nHydration and Nutrition:\n \nStay hydrated throughout your workouts and ensure you're fueling your body with a balanced diet that includes a good mix of proteins, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables.\n \nRemember, consistency is key. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts as your fitness improves. If you have any health concerns or medical conditions, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise routine."

Weight loss/fat loss/overall heatlh is like 75% diet, 25% exercise.  So you'll need to do some research on that first (some great sources are eattoperform or bengreenfieldfitness to start).\n \nAs for a weekly plan....  Honestly, I'm apprehesive to suggest anything specific simply because I don't know you or your body and how you respond to movement.  The exercises you mentioned - dance, strength, yoga and running - are all very effective in helping with gaining strength and improving cardio health.  I say try one each day and see what you're drawn to.  You can also try high intensity training (also known at HIT or HIIT).  Even try studios like Orangetheory, Pure Barre, even Crossfit.  See what you'll like and what you're willing to continue with. What piques your interest is what you'll be willing to dedicate your time to and work for.\n \nI do agree that running for weight loss is a tricky topic.  I suggest you do more research on it.  But doing sprints and tempo runs work really well with increasing VO2 max capacities and help bring you into a fat burning mode instead of sugar burning (this is ben greenfield's aim).  \n \nAlternate your workouts.  Don't forget to build in rest.  And working out a solid hour a day HARD isn't necessary.  Get your heart rate up 20-30 minutes a day for strength training and cardio.  Work your body hard during that short time...push yourself.  It'll be more effective than spending an hour in the gym mindlessly lifting weights.  Give yourself some bodywork therapy (pilates, yoga) to balance out the other workouts (those can be an hour - 90 min).   \n \nFinally, while I don't feel comfortable giving  you a specific workout, I can tell you what's worked for me in the past:\n \nDay 1 - strength training (20-30) with a trainer...hard\n \nDay 2 - sprint or tempo work\n \nDay 3 - Pilates\n \nDay 4 - strength training\n \nDay 5 - spring or tempo work \n \nDay 6 - Yoga\n \nDay 7 - Rest\n \nSince I'm a Pilates instructor, I usually do Pilates mat/props 5-6 days a week.  But those listed on the above schedule are sessions in the studio either guided by another instructor or myself on the machinery.   \n \nSo...\nfind studios/workouts/trainers that you'll stick with which also push you\ndo strength training and hard cardio 20-30 min on those designated days\ntry hour long classes for dance, yoga, and pilates\ndon't forget to rest\nwork your diet to support your new activities\nGood luck!!"

Whether you're looking to shed some pounds, build muscle, or boost your overall health, finding the right workout is key to sustaining motivation and achieving your goals. Let's dive into the world of fitness and shed light on how to choose the best workout tailor-fitted to your needs and lifestyle.\n \nUnderstanding Your Fitness Goals\n \nBefore jumping into the latest fitness craze, it's essential to get a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. Here's how to set realistic and personal goals:\nWeight Loss:\n If your aim is to lose weight, focus on workouts that enhance \ncardiovascular health\n and burn significant calories, such as HIIT, running, or spinning classes.\nMuscle Gain:\n For those looking to gain muscle mass, strength training and resistance exercises like weightlifting or bodyweight exercises will be your go-to.\nEndurance Building:\n Sports such as swimming, cycling, or long-distance running can increase your stamina and improve heart and lung function.\nFlexibility and Balance:\n Yoga and Pilates provide a perfect blend of stretching and core workouts to enhance these areas.\nOnce your goals are outlined, consider how each workout aligns with your lifestyle and how they can be incorporated into your daily regime.\n \nConsidering Workout Preferences and Lifestyle\n \nYour workout should not only meet your fitness goals but also jive with your interests and schedule. Consistency will become infinitely easier if you enjoy the process. Ask yourself:\nDo you prefer solitary workouts where you can go at your own pace, like jogging or solo weight training sessions?\nAre group classes such as Zumba, spinning, or CrossFit more motivating and fun for you?\nDoes your routine allow long workout periods, or are shorter, more intense sessions like Tabata training better?\nBalance is vital\u2014not just on the yoga mat but also in scheduling workouts that fit into your life seamlessly.\n \nWorkout Types: Pros, Cons, and Who They're Best For\n1. HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)\n \nPros:\nEfficient, burns many calories in a short period\nBoosts metabolism for hours after the workout\nCons:\nMay be challenging for beginners\nHigher risk of injury if not done with proper form\nBest for:\n Individuals with limited time seeking fast results.\n \n2. Cardiovascular Exercises (Running, Cycling)\n \nPros:\nImproves heart health and burns calories\nCan be done anywhere\nCons:\nCan be monotonous\nImpact on joints\nBest for:\n Beginners to advanced; those who enjoy outdoor activities.\n \n3. Strength Training (Gym Workouts, Calisthenics)\n \nPros:\nBuilds muscle and strength\nIncreases metabolism\nCons:\nRequires equipment or gym access\nProgress may be slower\nBest for:\n Those looking to tone up or increase strength.\n \n4. Yoga and Pilates\n \nPros:\nImproves flexibility and core strength\nReduces stress\nCons:\nMay not burn as many calories\nRequires patience and discipline\nBest for:\n Individuals seeking a low-impact option focusing on mental and physical well-being.\n \nIncorporating Recovery and Nutrition\nRemember that the best workout routine is incomplete without proper recovery and nutrition. Always schedule rest days to allow your body to recover, and fuel your workouts with a balanced diet rich in proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and micronutrients. Hydration is also non-negotiable\u2014keep the water flowing!\n \nConclusion\n \nThe best workout for you is one that you enjoy, that fits your lifestyle, and that moves you towards your fitness objectives. Assess your preferences, experiment with different types, and listen to your body's responses.

If you want the quality of The Rock or Matt Bomer's washboard abdominal muscles, or the speed or agility of Usain Bolt or Cam Newton, you have to work. If your goals are not so lofty (you want to feel good, maybe lose a few pounds, or just keep your place), then you still have to figure out how the fitness class will fit your life. Don't worry, through these strategies, no matter what kind of fitness \"guy\" you are, we can cover everyone.\nFor the guy who has no free time\n \nWe see, you are very busy, and sometimes the gym falls at the bottom of the to-do list. Sorry to say that if you are serious about health and wellness, it will not happen. When you seem to have spoken all the hours of the day, you must find ways to increase efficiency. For example, bring lunch so you can spend half of your rest time on exercise and the other half on eating. Or consider becoming an early riser so that you can exercise before life happens, and then suddenly finish the exercise.\n \nShort\n \nThe good news: exercise does not have to take a few hours to take effect. \"The minimum effective amount of exercise is 4 minutes, which is the time for a drum exercise,\" said Josh Holland, a trainer in New York City and founder of Zoomtion Fitness. So, why not start your day with squats or push-ups (20 seconds, 10 seconds rest, 8 reps) while making coffee?\n \nHard to go home\n \nThis is not to say that long-term exercise will not bring more benefits, although Holland said that you only need 20 to 30 minutes, especially when you are training hard. His favorite is your best partner, including slow repetitive high-intensity strength training, aerobic sprinting and endurance isometric tests.\n \nThis weight loss routine is the perfect partner exercise\n \nA cry for you\n \nStrengthen Strength: Choose 5 to 7 multi-joint exercises (such as front squat, overhead press, bench press, low row exercise and pull down exercise), and perform slow repetitive exercises (concentric and eccentric) for about one and a half minutes for each exercise Exercise 5-6 seconds), respectively. Holland said: \"The weight should be heavy enough to make you tired.\"\n \nFor aerobic exercise: choose aerobic exercise mode (running, biking, rowing, even skipping). Go all out for 12 to 15 seconds. Indeed not, do your best, this is not a half-way time. Recover up to one minute (up to three minutes), and then recover 6 to 10 times. Holland said: \"When your distance starts to shrink, then it's time for you to quit.\"\n \nFor long-lasting: This fast exercise can be done in your living room using your own body weight. Use wall sitting, planks, handstands or spear rests and lunges rest to create isometric circuits. Move continuously for 1 minute at a time and complete the loop as much as possible until the table fails. Make it more difficult by extending the time.\n \nFor those who are not motivated\n \nFor whatever reason, when you stretch your hips toward the gym, you seem to be dragging your feet. It\u2019s not that you are afraid of it, but because it\u2019s much easier to procrastinate or get yourself into work, such as Netflix or aimless web surfing or coworkers\u2019 happy hours, and suddenly, you are not for the week.\n \nSet a goal\n \nYou\u2019ve heard it before, but if you don\u2019t have a clear intention, it\u2019s difficult to measure progress and you don\u2019t even have the motivation to try. Add numbers to it, such as the specific weight loss you want to achieve within a specific time period (remember that 2 pounds a week is considered healthy and sustainable). Or consider the goal of skill or strength: perfect skipping leg training, lift body weight (or 1.5 times or twice the body weight) on the bench or deadlift, pull up 10 or 20 pull-ups, master the muscles, and start Exercise the number of miles within a certain time frame and so on. \"Using test and retest models,\" Holland said. Set a benchmark and then conduct a self-test once a week or every two weeks to assess progress.\n \nLet others hold you accountable\n \nAn exercise partner who is already a gym rat may be your new best friend. Cheer him up by asking for his opinion, suggesting to provide a whistleblower, or keeping up with him, you need someone to whip your ass. Or even promise to pay for the smoothie after exercise to help you get up and drag you there, and don\u2019t let him refuse."

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes."

And there is some value in it, if only just for entertainment sometimes (especially on the internet). But let's just get one thing straight here - if you are doing \nany\n kind of workout then it's going to have a greater impact than if you weren't. Simple as that.\n \nOf course there are caveats. You don't want to get hurt, so they can pretty much all be summed up into one commandment: Thou shalt not be an idiot. Getting under a bar loaded with 495 lbs and squatting it is an experience reserved for a very small percentage of people. There is zero reason to think that you need to do that unless you are 100% sure you can. And the people that do it take safety precautions when they do because they know s@&t can go sideways for the best of us so it makes sense to be prepared. That doesn't mean don't lift heavy. It \ndoes\n mean that heavy is a relative concept, not an absolute one. If 95 lbs feels super-heavy to you on bench then guess what? It is. The dude on the bench next to you repping 315 is not relevant to your perception.\n \nYou know all the things people like to give huge importance to? Things like \u201cHow long should I rest between sets?\u201d, \u201cHow many reps should I do?\u201d, \u201cAre preacher curls better than standing curls?\u201d, \u201cShould I drink a protein shake during my workout or after? How long after?\u201d \u2026 are all interesting questions but the truth is the answers have more to do with refinement than gross progress. Get in, lift weights, eat food and don't be an idiot and you will build muscle.\n \nThen there's cardio. Want to create a calorie deficit? Do cardio. Want to improve your heart\u2019s performance? Do cardio. Should you do HIIT? Sure. Why not. Should you do long, slow duration? Sounds good. My rule for cardio is this: if you're just putting in the time then you won't get too much out of it. Come up with little challenges for yourself and then beat them. Maybe it's a certain calories/minute average. Maybe it's maintaining a certain speed for a certain time. Maybe it's keeping your heart rate above a certain number. Maybe it's that you want your shirt to be fully drenched when you're done. Whatever it is I promise that setting a goal and then beating it will ensure your cardio has an impact. Getting too detailed about it is great for refinement but once again the gross value is in making it happen.\n \nMost of us who train won't be Mr. Olympia, or win an Ironman triathlon. At the elite levels there are little refinements that need to be made, but those vary on an individual basis. For the general population who wants to be fit, healthy and strong (and look good along the way) overthinking is overwhelming. As Nike so perfectly puts it, just do it."

OH WELL!\n \nSquats or squat Lunge combination: There are 4 weight bearing activities that work 33% of all the muscles in the body. \nSquats, Lunges, Power cleans. and dead lifts - thats 33% for each exercise type.\nI\u2019ve misplaced the referencing link for researching it your self.. but these exercises use the most proprioception, over the greatest variety of execution and total range in conjunction to plane of motion muscles than pullups than other exercise mentioned in this post.\n \nAnother huge quality of Squats or squat lunge combination are your bodies pich points where the fluids coursing through your arteries veins and capillaries are momentarily pinched ie pressurized causing blood flow to vascularize and expand all of your internal organs - conditioning them as well..\n \nThis concept is one of the most missed areas of fitness by so called Gurus, celebrity trainers and fitness researchers of muscle performance.\n \nLastly I see Plyometrics and Par Kour as a tie for the third best exercise..\nNeither require you to be a weight head who only see fitness as skin deep..\n \nPar Kour requires an ever evolving skill and no matter what level you achieve it will give you a work out because of the direct changes your body is forced to adapt just to be able to do the basics.. and if you learn this with weights then bam you get both the fitness and the physical proficiency of being in shape.\n \nPlyo metrics shakes things up alot. The weight of the fluid in your body will conditioning you. Think of plyometrics as calisthenics that will take your bretah away every time and all the time..It\u2019s exercising at your muscles legal limit.\n \nThese exercises have nothing to do with staying clear of injury\u2019s as any exercise if there is an error in calculating your ability will cause injury.. So the guy who crying foul about injury should be kicked out of fitness period and head to the rehab facilities because you cant get fit be fit or stay fit the way he his mindset be training you. He\u2019s stuck at wanting a doctor credential not a advancing the needs of the client.\n \nWith any of these three exercises if you add Exercise Short Codes.. your fitness will be sustainable the best for the rest of your life.. As you can get better withn age\n \nAuthor of The Non Exercise\u2019s Guide to Nourishing Your Soul\u2019s Journey"

        "answer": "Squat: First of all, you will never not want to be able to get up off the ground. When loaded and done properly, the squat will have positive effects on your quads, glutes, hams, abs, low back, lats, and upper back, as well as increasing stability and proper movement patterns in the knees, ankles and hips.

Deadlifts work all the muscles worked in the squat with more of an emphasis on the back muscles, plus traps and rotator cuff muscles. Get a good deadlift and reduce chances of random back injuries. \nBent Row: Many people have given an answer as a pressing movement. Although they do build a nice chest/shoulders, you're never really going to need to do a strict press in every day movements. Not only will the bent row improve your posture, but will also heavily tax your lats, low back, and abs. \nI've chosen these three because they're, in my opinion, the more important of the primal movement patterns to be done correctly. You will \nnot\n be able to build a well rounded, show ready physique, but you can become much, much stronger in every day life and while doing the majority of every day tasks."

Not only does it promote a sedentary routine, it is also terrible for your posture as the muscles required for healthy core are not as active, therefore will atrophy at a faster than ideal rate.

Try for three 30 minute cardio sessions a week. Running, biking, swimming, whatever gets your heart rate up. If you can't go 30 minutes, slow down until you can.\n \nSupplement this with strength and mobility exercises, either after the cardio or a different day. If you have access to weights, then stick with the major lifts: bench press, squat, deadlift, overhead press, lat pull down. If you don't, then use bodyweight exercises: push ups, pull ups, squats, planks and glute bridges. Finish up with stretches for mobility. Yoga is good for this too.\n \nOnce you know more about fitness and your body, you might decide you want the pick up truck body (weightlifters) the sprinter body (sports car) the long distance body (hybrid) or the obstacle course body (jeep). All are worthy goals, but if you're not sure, then start with the Accord."

I tend to run in intervals. 5 minutes straight running, 3 minutes walking, 3minutes running, 5 mins walking, 10 running, 1 walking, 4min run, etc. On the treadmill it\u2019s different, there\u2019s not a lot of impact on my feet and legs from terrain. This way I can protect my feet, and legs from micro trauma and lowers the risk of re-injury. I do this for about 30\u201360mins."

In fact i don't think it would be possible to create a more effective program for just getting stronger.\n \nI also do hill sprints for conditioning, twice a week at 80% effort on a 30 degree incline, for 15 - 20 seconds, with 40-45 seconds rest. 10 rounds each session. It's effective in that it's improved my overall stamina drastically, while maintaining muscle mass, and it doesn't make me sore (jogging destroys muscle mass and makes me very sore)."

It will be well worth the time and money. Talk about what you'd like to accomplish, what your goals are and ask if you could talk just a bit about nutrition and diet because that contributes greatly to getting to or staying at goal weight. Places I've worked out at include Tracy Anderson\u2019s Studio in LA, Barry\u2019s Bootcamp in LA, Pure Barre in Los Gatos, here in Northern California where I live. I\u2019ve studied ballet so I do some of those basic exercises. I love to dance so I\u2019ve done Zumba. I subscribe for free to XPT life with Gabby Reece and Laird Hamilton. They give weekly inspiration to get and keep you fit. She\u2019s an Olympian and he\u2019s a big wave surfer, so they are at the top of their game always, but I like to learn from the best! I hope I\u2019ve covered some of what you are asking. I still like the basics - do something cardio first, then sit-ups, planks front and side, lunges, burpees, squats, push-ups. I try to conquer the pull-up which remains hard for me. I ended up putting up a bar in my cellar, and sometimes I just hang from it, then I try hoisting myself up and down for as many times as I can which is usually only a few. I gotta keep working on that. Best of luck and thanks for stopping by\u2026"

Are you looking to squezze in some Aerobics for your cardiovascular endurance?\nTime: How much time are you willing to put in per week?\nFocus areas: Are there anything specific areas of particular interest? Are you looking to get a more defined upper body/lower body? or just want a good six pack to take your physique to the next level?\nNow having looked at that, let's go through a quick wrap-up of some of the most effective routines for strength and hypertrophy conditioning:\n \nFull-body workout routine\n \nThis aims at hitting all the major muscle groups in one session. It's widely considered as one of the best approaches for beginners looking to up their general body strength before taking up some more specific approaches. Each workout day is typically followed by a rest day to allow for muscle recovery.\n \nSplit Routines\n \nThis approach emphasizes a particular body region or a group of muscles per workout day. Good examples include the Upper/Lower Body and Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) Split Routines. The former typically alternates between upper and lower body Workouts in the first 2 days followed by a rest/recovery day. The latter alternates Push and pull workouts in the first 2 days followed by a leg day.\n \nCheck out this comprehensive read for more details on workout routines and how you can go about choosing what should work best for you:\nhttps://healthnuggetdotcom.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/workout-routines/"

Though this will build muscle, it won't lead to optimal muscle growth rates.\n \nInstead of bombing a muscle group each day with endless volume, you are better off targeting muscle groups several times per week with a smaller amount of volume per day. By training a muscle group 2-3x per week with a more moderate volume, you will experience a greater degree of weekly protein synthesis per muscle group, and as a result, more optimal gains.\n \nIf you want to build muscle as rapidly as possible, consider switching to a full body workout. By targeting each muscle group 3 times per week, you will keep protein synthesis levels higher, on the average, which will lead to more optimal gains.\n \nFor intermediate lifters who have already built a quality amount of strength, training on an upper/lower or push/pull/legs split might be a better option. Heavy weight can take it's toll on joints and connective tissue, so a few extra days of rest per week might be beneficial\n \nGreets,\n \nJoel"

Because frankly, writing some long ass answer hailing myself and my good habits is just too awkward for my taste.\n \nI\u2019ve always been bad at flossing.\nDENTAL flossing.\nThat\u2019s more like it.\n \nI\u2019ve tried creating a steady flossing habit for what feels like my whole life.\n \nI often manage to get started too, but somehow, my routine always falls off a cliff. I\u2019m going at it, gaining steam for a couple weeks, and then\u201d\npoof,\u201d \nmy momentum stops, dead in its tracks.\n \nJust like with you and training, I know flossing is good for me. I\u2019ve seen horrific pictures of rotten, brown teeth and they scare the living shit out of me. I\u2019m definitely motivated to floss.\n \nWhat makes my failures even stupider is that flossing takes little to no time and doesn\u2019t require anything but the smallest amount of effort. I don\u2019t even have to leave the house\u2014I\u2019ve had the same damn flossers in my bathroom cabinet since the Mongols laid waste to all of Eurasia.\n \nI have no excuses.\n \nBut I can\u2019t do it.\n \nSo what gives?\n \nOne part of creating good habits is getting the ball rolling.\n \nBecause healthy routines are like a ball of snow rolling down a hill, steady gaining size and speed. It\u2019s hard to get it moving in the beginning and the longer we do something, the easier it is to keep doing it. But this, while true, is also not helpful. \u201cJust do it\u201d is bad advice, because \nwe\u2019re already trying to.\n \nThis view, of self-discipline=routines, creates a chicken-egg situation: to build healthy routines, we need self-discipline over a long period of time; but self-discipline is in itself a healthy routine, so how the flying fuck do we create that in the first place?\n \nAnother\u2014often underrated\u2014aspect of habit-creation is making the habit as \neasy to implement as possible.\n \nIt\u2019s not about powering through using the self-discipline we wish we had, but creating \nan environment\n where a habit is likely to prosper.\n \nI\u2019ve been flossing every day for 4 months now.\n \nI guess I deserve a medal or at least a diploma of some sort.\n \nWhat\u2019s crazy is how the way I finally made it stick is so stupid and simple I can\u2019t even fathom it.\n \nI put the flosser \nwith\n \nmy toothbrush.\n \nI was already brushing my teeth. I mastered that shit in kindergarten. Now, every time I do that deeply ingrained habit, I get an instant reminder to up my flossing game while I\u2019m at it.\n \nI also bought approximately a lifetime\u2019s worth of dental floss so I always have some available.\n \nBecause I know, If I have to go the store to buy some, it\u2019s not happening.\nWhen we start doing something new and challenging, our identity and previous habits become this force of nature, pulling us back, to our previous selves.\n \nOur status quo.\n \nTo oppose those forces, we need to create our own force field, one which pulls us toward the habits we wish to create.\n \nI see too many people spend their whole existence in an epic fight to go to a dimly lit place and lift weights/and or run on a treadmill.\n \nWorking out shouldn\u2019t be an epic battle.\n \nStupid as it is, we often stop doing what we achieve to do, not because we don\u2019t want to do the core thing, but because of all the small annoyances we associate it with.\n \nIf you\u2014like me\u2014ever skipped a work-out because you lacked the proper socks, had a bad hair-day or because it was raining and fuck if you\u2019re going out in the rain, you know this all too well.\n \nWe should aim to minimise the friction and pain associated with creating a habit and maximise the friction and pain associated with not creating it.\n \nWe should strive to make training as tempting as possible, while avoiding it should be hard and painful.\n \nI floss, not because of my super-saiyan willpower, but because I\u2019ve minimised the friction flossing creates in my life and head, while making the implementation of the habit as smooth and pain-free as possible.\n \nHere are some specific examples as to how you can create an environment where the habit of exercise is likely to prosper:\nPrepare the things you need beforehand.\n Have your gym bag with clean clothes, water bottle, towel, etc ready. Fill it with everything you need and put it by your door. It will serve as a constant reminder, telling you how close you are to go to the gym.\nSet a fixed time.\n Ever postponed anything? Yeah, me too. So why not schedule your training? By giving giving training a specific time and place, much like a deadline, we can making procrastination an as small a factor as possible. Put that shit in your calendar if you have too\u2014it\u2019s what I do for my studies.\nKnow where you\u2019re going to train and become familiar with the place and logistics.\n Where is the water fountain? \nIs there \na water fountain? What equipment do they have? When is the best time to go? These logistics, while seemingly minuscule, can add up to a lot of friction and make it harder than it has to be to make this habit stick.\nHave a training plan. \nThere is a syndrome in the fitness industry popularly termed \u201cfuckarounditis.\u201d Fuckarounditis, while bad for progress, is also inherently unhelpful for making training a habit. Don\u2019t just plan to go to the gym today. Plan to go, do X exercises for X reps/time with X goal in mind. If you\u2019re going to the gym, with no plan and no particular goal you wish to accomplish, procrastinating on it becomes very tempting.\nSet some specific short-term goals and measure your progress. \nHave something you wish to accomplish every day you\u2019re there. Maybe it\u2019s lifting 1 rep more than last time, running a bit longer, or something as simple as improving at a certain movement. Mastery waters and stimulates motivation while incompetence kills it. Take advantage of that\nGet to know those who work there.\n You don\u2019t have to be friends or anything, but make a bit of small talk. Say hi. Smile. Get to know the lines of their faces. A familiar smile is a lot more appealing than a strangers glance.\nMake your workout part of a routine.\n A popular tip I give is to train on the way home from work or on the way to it. The road from your coach to the front door can feel longer and more daunting than a marathon on pouring rain. Going by the gym when you\u2019re already out and about is on the other hand often as close to effortless as it gets.\nGo with a friend. \nSocial pressure is real. Cancelling an appointment is a lot harder than postponing a workout in your head. As a bonus, camaraderie can also make training more enjoyable. Yes, it should be enjoyable too.\nIf all else fails, hire a personal trainer and set up sessions several months in advance. \nIn the business, we use this as a tactic because it minimises flakiness. While people may want to avoid working out, they also don\u2019t like calling someone to cancel an appointment they\u2019re paying for and know they should go to. You can use this too your advantage too.\nHave some fun.\n The best way to keep going to the gym is to actually enjoy yourself while you\u2019re there. Experiment a bit. Find out what part of training is the most fun or at least sucks less. Too many treat the gym as a place of suffering. Counterintuitively, this makes it harder to go than it has to be. When you find something enjoyable about it, you may even find yourself wanting to go. In the end, that\u2019s what makes habits stick. People who wake up at 5am in the morning don\u2019t do so because they\u2019re running on extreme amounts of willpower, but because they, crazy as it is, actually enjoy it."

To build functional strength, compound movements are the best way to go.  Compound movements are Olympic type lifts that require you to transition from one large muscle group to another large muscle group.  For instance, in the power-clean, you go from a deadlift start and end up standing with the weight pressed above your head.  Obviously you will not be able to clean as much weight as you would if you were doing a normal deadlift since you will have to press the weight over your head.\n \nThe difficulty I have in suggesting a customized training plan for anyone that I don\u2019t get to work with in the gym is that everyone is different in their strengths and weaknesses and while one lifter may have more endurance, another may have more explosive power.  These two lifters will respond differently to a set workout and it\u2019s up to a good coach to recognize when to push one aspect (explosive power) or the other (higher reps).\n \nGenerally, to build muscle strength and density, you should use a pyramid scheme that focuses on at least five sets, excluding your first and maybe your second set which is merely a warmup.  After your warmup with extremely light weights, your next three lifts will incrementally build up to your last two sets, which is where the work and growth really begins.  Your last two sets should be at a weight where you are on the verge of struggling, while keeping good form.  On the bench, your last two sets should require your spotter to keep a careful eye on your lifting, ready to assist if necessary.\n \nIf you\u2019re lifting heavy weights, then the number of sets you should do will increase because you\u2019re need more sets to safely work up to your max weight, and your muscles will need more work to get to the top weight.  For instance, approximately 8 weeks through a 13 week lifting cycle is when I want to start hitting certain milestones to ensure I will be at the top of my game come competition time.  Here\u2019s a typical example of my bench workout.\nWarmup with just the bar;\nWarmup with just the bar;\n10 reps at 135;\n6 reps at 185;\n6 reps at 225;\n6 reps at 275;\n6 reps at 315;\n6 reps at 345 - This is my working set\n6 reps at 375 - This is the second of my working set.\nAlthough this \u201croutine\u201d seems pretty standard, the importance of having a good coach cannot be understated.  What my coach would do is watch how easy I did a set, then calculate what the next weight would be.  For instance, if on #7 I slowed down on rep 5 & 6, meaning my explosive power was waning, he would either make me rest a bit more to allow me to recover more, but not too much, or on set #8, he may move the weight only to 330.  The object is to be able to hit your working weight and complete it almost to exhaustion.  If I was having a particularly bad day, I may take out a set and adjust the weight accordingly.  What was most important is hitting your working sets and completing them.  This is important for several reasons, but the primary reason you want to complete your working sets is psychological.  When it comes down to it, it doesn\u2019t matter what weight you lifted on set#6, or even if you have a set #6, what matters is you hit your goal for that week.  You\u2019re setting yourself up for success the following week by being successful this week.\n \nIt is so important to hit your goals that even on weeks where I found myself stronger than expected, i.e. I blew through my first working set without any issue and it feels like I can add another 50# for my second working set with no problem, instead of increasing my goal for that week, I was told to focus on more explosion or better form and technique instead of adding additional pounds to that week\u2019s goal.  What the coach may then do is recalculate \nnext\n week\u2019s goal a bit higher.\n \nI guess the take away from this long winded answer is to set a lifting cycle for at least three months.  Start the first week by doing approximately six sets for eights, the second week, drop off a rep and do six sets for seven, increasing each successive set\u2019s weight more than the week before.  You should be able to handle this as you\u2019re taking away a rep.  Next week, drop a rep and increase the weight\u2026.\n \nIt\u2019s important to set a goal and take the necessary incremental steps to reach that goal.  Some people go to they gym with the attitude of \u201cI want to get stronger\u201d, which is good, but difficult to achieve because it is so ambiguous.  However, if you say \u201cToday I can do a max one rep bench at 225 and in 12 weeks I want to be able to max at 275\u201d that is a goal that can be tracked accurately and you can adjust your weights, sets, reps, diet, sleeping accordingly.  At the end of the 12 weeks, hit your goal then take a week away from the gym, maybe a bit more, then come back and say \u201cToday I can do a max one rep bench at 275 and in 12 weeks I want to be able to max at 315.\u201d  Then, you chalk up your hands and get to work."

It was great, but I didn't get the results I wanted. I didn't dedicate enough time to weight training or even structure my diet correctly.\n \nThat all changed when I decided I wanted to body build seriously and start showing my results on stage. That\u2019s the scary bit\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving your body scrutinised by judges and the audience. I didn\u2019t care; I knew I could build the body I wanted. It was somewhere growing inside of me, and I just needed a proper coach\u200a\u2014\u200aand to commit.\nThen and there, my weight training journey began, and it hasn\u2019t stopped since.\nLearning new things on this journey never stops. There are always pit stops and pivots during the stages of ageing and hormonal shifts. Then when you throw lockdowns in the mix, things can get pretty heated. Here's is the best of the best during my 15-year journey of bodybuilding and nutrition.\n \nUse multi joining movements\n.\n \n(squats, lunges, deadlifts, bench pressing, pull-ups) to use the most muscle groups. These movements develop an athletic, shapely physique, burn more calories, strength and muscle mass. Using this technique every time you train will increase your results and get to your training goals faster. It has never failed me along the bodybuilding journey.\n \nDon't shy away from the intense movements.\n \nI see a lot of people disregarding squats, deadlifts and chin-ups. I know these are challenging, but throwing yourself into challenging movements will create successful results\u200a\u2014\u200aand fast.\n \nThere are instances when your doctor doesn\u2019t recommend a particular exercise\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s fine.\n \nBut what I\u2019d like to point out is that not using these muscle groups will produce weakness in your skeletal system, leading to problems in the future.\n \nI would follow my doctor\u2019s advice, and if I can do something, I\u2019d start very small. As you increase the weights you lift or the intensity of bands. Your body becomes stronger and will tolerate tension and load.\n \nDon\u2019t allow injured muscles to become so weak that they no longer help you lead a normal life. Make use of what you can do to keep strong and active.\n \nNutrition is key to your success.\n \nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you want to get leaner or build muscle\u200a\u2014\u200anutrition is your best friend. Assess your food choices, and adapt according to your needs. Those who want to lose weight will have different requirements than those who build muscle.\n \nOne big question I get is, \"can I do both at the same time?\" Well, sure you can, but one will outweigh the other. Too much cardio can lead to loss of muscle mass. Weight training more than four times a week can lead to less effective results & burnout - and worst still, injury. There needs to be a balance of both mediums.\n \nHow do you discover this balance? No one can tell you what works for your body better than you can. It's a matter of getting into the trenches, trying things out, experimenting and writing down your results.\n \nOver time, you will discover the dos and do not\u2019s of your body. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer for this \u2014 it takes hard work and a lot of guessing \u2014 and it keeps changing as you age.\n \nLet yourself off the hook, throw perfectionism out the window, do your best, and your best is the right place to start.\n \nKnowing what to do and performing it correctly are two different things.\n \nExecuting movements with weights is one of the main reasons why I first hired a personal trainer.\nI wanted someone to tell me exactly what I should do and how to structure my posture correctly.\nI tried to get specific results, and it was easy to get the skills from a person who was already way ahead in the game.\n \nI applied their techniques and skills. Over time, I trained with a couple of other experts who brought even more skills for my success.\n \nThe easiest way to master weight training was because I asked for help. If I had done it myself, it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\n \nThe journey ahead never ends\n.\n \nThere will be endless points in your life where the journey changes.\nWe start to age, we change professions, have a family, experience hormonal shifts or develop an illness.\nThese issues can be very frustrating to anyone that has trained for many years. Things we did ten years ago don't work today.\n \nBut this is life telling us we need to change, alter and find a different way.\n \nThat could mean training a lot less, recovering more, watching your nutrition like a hawk, or trying intermittent fasting. The alternatives are endless, but start with one thing at a time and wait. Along my bodybuilding journey, I ate 5 -6 meals a day.\n \nBack then, I was about 35. Now at 42, I can't handle that many meals, and I'm just not as hungry as I once was. So we just have to make do with what is presented to us right now.\n \nI want to finish this off by saying that when you have a goal In mind, you will then look for the means to attract those results. I always had a set idea of what I wanted.\n \nOnce you've achieved your goal, moving on to something else will keep the flame of fitness alive.\n \nAs we grow up, we develop a love for other things. Perhaps for you, it may be pushing your body to its limit.\n \nMaybe someone else might decide to take up yoga as well. The remarkable aspect of fitness, no matter what age, you can try an array of things to find out what starts to ignite an emotional trigger within you. For me, that's always been weight training.\n \nThere is no other form of exercise that ticks all the boxes for my needs, wants and wishes.\n \nWhat will yours be?\n \nPlease also join me on my various social platforms and do go ahead and download your \n40 Fat Loss Tips & Portions guide.\n I'm also on \nInstagram\n & \nMedium"

I want a healthier heart, lungs and body.\n \nI have some ancillary goals about losing weight, loosen my leg and back muscles and strengthen my back. But my workout right now already helps with a lot of those.\n \nSo, really, I just focus on working up a good sweat. \n \nTime\n. I just go in the morning now. No excuses. I don't do ridiculous 6am video conferences or calls anymore (some of the folks I work with are in Singapore, Russia, Bangalore, etc.) \n \nCut Friction\n. Within 10 minutes of waking up I'm in my gym clothes. I keep my key, headphones, water bottle and iPad near the front door so I take them all as I head out to the gym. Same thing if you run or walk to workout.\n \nI think the reason so few folks swim or bike for exercise anymore is because of the friction. You have to wear special apparel, shower after and wash out the chlorine (another reason why saltwater pools are much better), and then soak your bathing suit, swim cap, googles in water to get the chlorine out, etc.\n \nUnless you work from home, try having two gyms you like - one near work and another near home. In each case, pick the gyms closest to you that you will actually work out in. \n \nI had a home elliptical and a gym 10 feet from my doorstep. I didn't use either much. Now I work out daily because I like my gym and figured out a routine.\n \nWhen I worked in New York, I had two gyms - a free one a work and an Equinox across the street from my home for which I had a work discount. I used both a lot. At one point, the trainer at the work gym said \"Terrence, you don't need to come every day.\" I worked out a lot sometimes. I joined the Reebok gym briefly but it was too far. So even though it was even nicer than Equinox, I worked out more at Equinox.\n \nThe Workout\n. Here's what works for me. I do the 15% max incline on the treadmill in our building's gym. I listen to music, use my iPad and have a water bottle. I do between 20 min to 4 hours of cardio a day, depending. Average is probably 80 minutes. \n \nWhy do I do a 15% incline? Because it is less strain on my knees and back to walk uphill than to run at 0-2% incline. And I can do stuff on my iPad while I'm walking.\n \nAlmost anyone can do this workout. It is super easy. And you can make it hard. Just walk much faster and longer and you'll get a pretty good workout after awhile.\n \nI keep track of my heart rate so its between fat burn and a good burn but not dangerous. Then I try to stretch or lift weights. High reps, low weight. I'm trying to avoid injury so easing into weights. Once I build this into a habit, I will switch it up a bit and do stationary bike, stair climbing, rowing, etc. \n \nRest. \nI take Saturdays off. Mostly because I get up at 5.30am every Saturday to hop on a plane. So I'm already a bit exhausted on most Saturdays. But also partly to stay sane and reward myself. And build a routine I will stick with."

        "question": "Which 3 exercises would give me the most complete workout?",

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes."

There are a variety of squat, push, and pull movements that you can perform, depending on the equipment you have access to. Assuming you\u2019re using free weights, I\u2019ll suggest the following:\nFront Squat\nBench Press\nBent-Over Row\nIf you don\u2019t have access to weights, and you\u2019re strictly doing bodyweight exercises, then you could do the following:\nBulgarian Split Squat\nPush-Up\nPull-Up\nBut again, any workout that limits you to just three exercises will still leave out several important foundational movements, so I don\u2019t understand why you would impose such a strange and arbitrary limitation like this on your workouts."

Just make sure that push-ups are a part of your training everyday.\n \nSquats\n \nThe squat is another classic lifting exercise that is especially beneficial to the lower body. The exercise directly works the hips and hamstrings. It also indirectly strengthens your core and even your upper body if done with weight. Amateur weightlifters often times focus on their upper body and neglect the lower half. Don't fall for that. Any training regimen should work the entire body and squats are an essential piece. They're that good for you.\n \nDeadlift\n \nThe deadlift builds total-body strength. It's a gimmie for the best-exercise title, but it does come with risks. The wrong technique can injure your back, so it's important to keep it flat throughout the lift. When the deadlift is executed correctly it will strengthen your back as well as your calves, quads, hamstrings, core and forearms.\n \nThe lift is simple and with the proper focus and attention to technique it can be completed without injury. The goal is to pick up a weighted bar off the ground and bring it up to your thighs using your whole body. The completion of the lift will have you standing up, your arms straight with the weight hanging.\n \nThe deadlift is effective at building strength because the inert weight starts on the ground and must be lifted up in a controlled movement. The lifter doesn't have a chance to use any momentum, hence the \"dead\" name.\n \nSource: \nThe 7 Best Exercises for a Full-Body Workout\n \nThe 5 Best Exercises For A Full-Body Workout"

A shorts rom, but enough to give you power to jumpe, sprint etc (which is a short rom too if you break it down). With heavy weights over your head, everything under (back, core, glutes and ofc shoulders girdle) it has to stabilise it, like pillars holding a roof. It devolops massive triceps and delts, even traps and CHEST. Yes. The entire upper body except biceps and. Unlike chest presses, overhead presses develops the delt much much better, and works the meatiest part of the tricep more. You will have a more round chest (less down-heavy like benchers) and wider, rounder delts. Also produces less injury than benching due to more balansed development (and you can actually drop it on the floor, unlike a bench press..). The weight will be heavy AF on the way down since you used legs to get it up. Humans are stronger on exentric reps, and this exercise is actually HEAVIER for that part, which is unique. It may allow you to hold weights close to your max bench OVERHEAD and standing up. Possibly the #1 exercise of all time.\n \nTHREE\n \nWeighted chins will develop the muscles that have already been hit, but not hammered. 2/3 of your torso muscles (or more) will be crushed. Biceps, forearms, lats, rhomboids, rear delts (which compensates for the push press), lower and middle traps, abs and even a bit of upper chest (according to studies). Can be done very heavy.\n \nIf you get to a 1.5x weight on all these exercises (on chins that means adding 50% of your own bw) for a few reps, you will not have any imbalance. Unlike squat bench and dead, these exercise includes explosive training. They will also give you better delts and traps and a more \u201cmasculine\u201dchest. You will be more athletic with those, and more balanced. Squat bench dead has no upper body pulling to work biceps and rear delts, and the bench almost exclusively works the front part. Bad. Another benefit is that squats and deads have higher injury risk, but explosive movements with a moderate weight might build the same size without overloading soft tissue.\n \nPlease let me know what you think"

Psychologist's call these people, 'Over-Motivated Underachievers' because they work hard (a prized cultural skill) but don't necessarily get anywhere because the body just can't handle high amounts of stress for long periods of time.\n \nThis is why phases are essential, your body needs rest to adapt.\n \nGenerally speaking most people can't tolerate high volume and high intensity at the same time (intensity is how high the percentage of 1RM any lifts are...1RM or above is the highest intensity), so you must balance the two. \n \nThis could be as simple as alternating between intensification phase and an accumulation phase (i.e. one phase is intense, low volume, high load - the other is volume oriented, lower intensity, higher volume, medium to low load).\n \nIt can be as complex as undulating sequences too, there are many components to neuromuscular training.\n \nDown weeks are also crucial here if you have high intensity or high volume training phases, allowing for supercompensation to take place is essential.\n \nWork + Rest = Success\n \n4 - Rest Changes\n \nThe less rest you give yourself between sets, between exercises, between training days and between training cycles, the harder it is on your system.\n \nThe more intense a workout, the more rest you need between sets and possibly workouts/phases.\n \nThe more volume in a workout, the more rest you need between workouts.\n \nManipulate rest to longer when you need it, and shorter when you want to challenge your nervous system in a new way.\n \nAgain - in phases.\n \n5 - Multi-Planar Adaptation\n \nThe problem with simplifying leg training to two major lifts is that these lifts often only address one plane of movement, forward and back (Sagital Plane it's called). \n \nYour muscles are 3-D, meaning you had better include some exercises eventually somewhere that require you to move laterally (i.e. Side Lunges, Lateral Sled Pushing, Shuffling, etc...) and rotationally (the transverse plane includes movements like chops, lifts, throwing, etc...).\n \nScientifically speaking, the body is capable of generating more power when engaged through all three planes (think of the amount of watts generated throwing a baseball or a shotput, it's significantly more than even a world-class squat or deadlift). \n \nDon't forget also to train unilaterally (one leg, like single leg squats, step-ups, lunges, etc...) as this forces the body into multiple planes of resistance.\n \nYou're leaving a lot of muscle untouched by training just two movements, or by using the majority of machines, and you're not refining your nervous system optimally.\n \ni.e. Single Leg, Single Arm Deadlifts challenge the body in all three planes. So would rotational rows, and standing position chops and lifts, among many others.\n \nSo would the majority of throwing activities, hitting activities, kicking (though more of the angular type found in soccer), etc... \n \nI'm not saying you should load patterns similar to your sport (you shouldn't, it's actually been shown to alter movement patterns to a point of decreased performance) but you should get out of the Saggital plane with your training from time to time and challenge your muscles as they are intended to be used, in 3-D).\n \nThere are a lot of good lifts at the gym that people either don't use correctly, or simply don't know.\n \n6 - Mechanical Loading Changes\n \nAre you lifting in your barefeet or in shoes, because the difference can matter to how your body responds. Barefoot will tax your feet/toes more than in shoes.\n \nThere are other considerations though, the overhead squat is significantly harder than a front or back squat because the mechanical advantage in the lift is reduced by the placement of the load above the head.\n \nPutting a dumbbell on one side only, taxes your body and your nervous system differently.\n \nPutting a dumbbell on the shoulders instead of the hands.\n \nA barbell instead of a dumbbell.\n \nChanging the angle of pull (wide stance, vs narrow stance) will change the outcome.\n \n7 - Threshold Considerations\n \nTraining the squat and deadlift all the time will train a lot of muscle, but it won't train the nervous system to respond to low threshold situations.\n \nYour nervous system is tuned to relax and contract at varying levels of intensity, so if low levels of intensity are out of whack (things like breathing, spinal segmental stabilization, etc...) your ability to fully engage at high nervous system thresholds is diminished.\n \nSo nervous system training kind of resembles a sliding scale from low to high threshold activities.\n \nIt seems a little on the 'girly' side (\nfor most men - while most women avoid the high threshold stuff\n) sometimes, but it's the smart way to train.\n \nEnsure that your body can tolerate body weight squats just as well as loaded squats. Basic glute bridges, just as well as heavy deadlifts.\n \nThese low threshold exercises are great for warm-ups.\n \ni.e. clamshells, quadruped lifts, plank variations, deadbugs, etc...\n \n8 - Range of Motion Considerations\n \nA quarter squat isn't the same as a full squat. The glutes and hamstrings are far more engaged in the latter.\n \nMobility training is important, and I generally encourage people to move through 'as full a range of motion as possible' when I'm coaching people. \n \nWork to improve your range of motion appropriately through all the major lifts, it will help a lot in your development at the gym.\n \nHowever, shortening up the range of motion can occasionally lead to break-throughs, and has it's place.\n \ni.e. you get stuck at the same spot on your bench press all the time, we can increase your strength at that point but employing a board press where you get stuck.\n \n9 - Addressing Weaknesses\n \nYou could squat and deadlift and hit a lot of muscle, but you'll plateau eventually.\n \nAt that point you'll want to start using accessory movements to push through them.\n \nIf hamstrings are the weak link then maybe we want to address them a little more intensely with romanian deadlifts or single leg romanian deadlifts, or glute ham raises?\n \nIf the glutes are the weak link, maybe we want to do some pull-throughs, or some loaded hip thrusts.\n \nIf the calves are a weak link, maybe we want to do some calf raises seated or standing, or some explosive jump training (which always lights my calves up...).\n \nUltimately, I'm missing some considerations for sure but the leg does the following movements worth training at some point:\n \nCircumduct the Ankle (rotation at the ankle)\nSupination and Pronation of the Ankle (Roll the foot inward and outward)\nPlantar Flex the Ankle (push foot down)\nDorsi Flex the Ankle (pull foot up)\nExtension/Flexion of Foot + Toes\nFeet Assist in Stabilizing the Ankle and Knee\nFlex and Extend the Knee\nStabilize the Knee\nExternally and Internally Rotate the Hip\nFlex and Extend the Hip\nADDuct and ABduct the Hip\nStabilize the Hip\nCombinations of all the above (the most likely and obvious training choices are ones that put your body through more than one of the movements above...)\nGood luck and enjoy yourself!"

This isn't your typical shrug; using a snatch grip (a wide grip) on the barbell really targets the upper traps more intensely than a regular grip.\n \nTo perform it, I stand with my feet shoulder-width apart, grip the barbell with my hands spaced wider than shoulder-width, and then shrug my shoulders up towards my ears. The wider grip increases the range of motion and really isolates the traps. I do three sets of 10-12 reps, focusing on a slow, controlled movement and a strong contraction at the top.\nAnother exercise that has yielded fantastic results for my traps is the \nFace Pull with External Rotation\n. This exercise not only works the traps but also hits the rear delts and improves shoulder health.\n \nUsing a cable machine with a rope attachment, I set the pulley at about face height. I pull the rope towards my face, focusing on keeping my elbows high and squeezing my shoulder blades together. At the end of the pull, I rotate my wrists outward to emphasize the contraction in my traps and rear delts. I aim for three sets of 15 reps, keeping the movement slow and controlled to maximize muscle engagement.\n \nLastly, the \nDumbbell Farmer's Walk\n is an underrated but incredibly effective exercise for building trap strength and endurance. I grab the heaviest dumbbells I can handle and walk back and forth across the gym. The constant tension from holding the heavy weights forces my traps to engage and support my shoulders.\n \nI usually do this for 3-4 sets, walking for about 30-60 seconds each set. Not only does this build my traps, but it also improves my grip strength and overall core stability.\n \nThey might not be the most common choices, but their effectiveness is undeniable. If you're looking to build impressive traps, give these a try \u2013 you won't be disappointed."

As requested, here are my before & after pictures:\n \nBefore Transformation (100 kgs at 5\u20328\u2033)\nAfter Transformation\n \n(72 kgs at 5\u20328\u2033)\nIt took me two and half years to achieve this transformation. I couldn't afford a personal trainer and I also wanted to know everything about fitness so that I can keep myself fit for lifelong without becoming too much dependent on others. So, I read and learned everything I could about various kinds of exercises & diets. I experimented with various split & full body routines. I tried various kinds of diets such as ketogenic & carb-cycling. I achived different level of results with all.\n \nSo, based on my experience, I can tell you that there are many ways to achieve the transformation you want but you can't and shouldn't limit yourself to just three exercises. That's why I am including more than three exercises, but only those that are the best. If you can create a program around these\n \nten exercises, you will be making good progress :\nBarbell Back Squat : \nIt's\n \nthe best exercise for your lower body. If done in correct form, and if you go below parallel, it will work not only your quads but also hamstrings, glutes and core.\nDeadlift\n \n: \nAlong with squats, deadlift is one of the best exercise to build overall mass and strength. It targets your posterior chain including hamstring, glutes, erector spine & lats. Your core gets a good workout and it also improves your grip strength & forearm size.\nStanding Calves Raise\n \n: \nI do it on smith machine standing on step board. It's best for calves.\nFlat & Inclined\n \nBench Press : \nBest exercise for chest but also works your anterior deltoids(front shoulders) and triceps. You can also do pushups for same effect but you won't be able to use as much weight as in bench press.\nMilitary Press : \nBest exercise to target shoulder.\nBent Over Barbell Rows : \nGood exercise for lats, middle back, biceps & core.\nPull Ups & Chin Ups\n :\n \nBest exercise for lats & biceps.\nParallel Bar Dips\n : Best for triceps.\nHIIT : \nFor cardiovascular health & fat loss. Sprint for 30 seconds and then walk for 30 seconds. Repeat for total 15 to 20 mins.\nYoga Poses : \nFor flexibility & proper alignment of body.\nP.S. : I know Yoga is not a single exercise but I included it to put emphasis on importance of flexibility & mobility work. Other kinds of flexibility & mobility routines will work too."

They don't just help you achieve wonderful, toned legs; they promote body-wide muscle building by creating an anabolic (muscle building) environment in the body. They work up your quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, abdominal muscles, lower back and your glutes too. Everyone should include them in your workout routine to get strong legs and thigh muscles.\n \nP.S. Performing Squats and Deadlifts is imperative to reduce the risk of injury.

Here\u2019s how I break it down:\nDay 1: Push Day (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)\nBench presses, overhead presses, dips, and push-ups. I mix up the rep ranges - some days it\u2019s heavy with lower reps, other days it\u2019s lighter with higher reps. This keeps the muscles guessing and growing.\nDay 2: Pull Day (Back, Biceps)\nDeadlifts, pull-ups, rows, and bicep curls. The deadlift is my bread and butter here. It\u2019s a full-body movement that\u2019s as functional as it gets, teaching the body how to move a heavy load safely.\nDay 3: Leg Day (Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes)\nSquats, lunges, leg presses, and Romanian deadlifts. Leg day is sacred. I go hard here because strong legs are the foundation of a strong body. I finish with calf raises because, hey, balance is everything.\nDay 4: Functional Day (Core, Mobility, Full Body)\nKettlebell swings, Turkish get-ups, farmer\u2019s walks, and core work. This is the day where I mix it up. The goal is to build functional strength - strength that translates to real-life activities. I focus on stability, coordination, and mobility, making sure my body is not just strong but also agile.\nI\u2019m not about that endless treadmill grind, but cardio has its place. After my strength work, I like to finish with high-intensity interval training (HIIT). It could be sprints, battle ropes, or a quick circuit of burpees, box jumps, and mountain climbers.\n \nThe idea is to get the heart rate up, torch some calories, and build endurance. This usually lasts 15-20 minutes, but it\u2019s enough to leave me drenched in sweat and feeling like a warrior.\n \nEvery session ends with a solid 10-15 minutes of stretching and mobility work. I focus on the areas I hit that day, making sure everything stays loose and limber. This is crucial for recovery, injury prevention, and keeping the body moving smoothly. I throw in some yoga-inspired moves because flexibility is just as important as strength.\n \nRest days are just as important as workout days. I take two full days off each week to let my body recover. This is when the magic happens - muscles repair, grow, and get stronger.\n \nI stay active with light activities like walking or swimming, but nothing too intense. I also make sure to get plenty of sleep and fuel my body with the nutrition - testosterone booster, healthy fats, and carbs to keep my energy levels high.\n \nMy gym routine is a living thing. It evolves as I do. If something isn\u2019t working or if I hit a plateau, I switch it up. I\u2019m always learning, always pushing the boundaries of what my body can do. The gym isn\u2019t just a place to work out; it\u2019s a place to challenge myself, to grow, and to become the best version of me.\n \nSo, that\u2019s my routine - a mix of strength, functionality, and a mindset that\u2019s always hungry for more. It\u2019s not just about building muscle; it\u2019s about building a body that\u2019s ready for anything. And trust me, when you approach the gym with this mindset, the results go way beyond the mirror."

However, this isn't true of CLion, which \ncan be very helpful\n right off the bat. Let's run through some of the advantages of using CLion:\n \nCLion makes it easy to start a new project. The wizard will generate a simple project structure with stub code that you can explore and run right away.\n \nThen, as you start writing code, CLion will highlight its structure and suggest improvements. This allows you to learn both the language itself and the best code practices from the very beginning.\n \nFor many error cases, CLion suggests quick-fixes, which means you can start memorizing the proper solutions right off the bat. For example, the IDE catches typical errors like dangling pointers \u2013 the types of errors that might pop up a lot when you\u2019re a newbie but can also be hard to debug.\n \nThe building, running, and debugging processes are completely transparent, as are VCS operations. You can control every step, see the exact commands, parameters, and flags that are being used, and experiment with them. If necessary, you can always perform the same actions in the built-in terminal.\n \nCLion allows you to become familiar with a variety of compilers and build systems. It works with gcc, Clang, MSVC compilers, and project formats, such as CMake, Makefile, Meson, and others.\n \nUnderstanding the underlying assembly is important when you\u2019re learning a language like C++. CLion allows you to examine the assembly of a file without having to build the entire project. You can change the compiler flags, refresh the assembly view, and see the effect immediately.\n \nAnd, of course, the IDE debugger is very convenient for learning. The IDE will help you investigate any runtime problem, including those that require memory analysis and disassembly.\n \nTo summarize, CLion will not overwhelm you with a complex set-up process and will not hide the essentials in the background. You\u2019ll be able to get up and running with a project in no time, while learning best code practices and efficient debugging right out of the gate.\n \nAnd if you\u2019re a student, you can get it all for free!"

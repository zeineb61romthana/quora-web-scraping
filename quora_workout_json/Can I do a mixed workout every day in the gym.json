As someone who has been working for long hours during the day, it is not possible for me to hit the gym every day of the week (although I want to). I can afford to go for 4 days at max, no matter how much I love working out, I understand that prioritizing gym before my work is not a good option for me, personally. This is why I try to cover my entire body during those 4 days.\nAt first, I struggled to find a workout split that would help me do all workouts in 4 days, but then I saw the push pull legs workout. I started following that, and the results were amazing. I even researched the whole mixed workout thing, and I understood that doing a mixed workout every day is better than the typical bro split, at least for me. You can easily target different muscles of your body and can focus more on compound lifts. These lifts help you burn more calories, build more muscle, and improve your strengths. Compound lifts also help you raise your testosterone levels, which is another advantage.\n \nNot only does it saves time, but it also helps you target each muscle group in a short period of time. I have been following the mixed workout split for almost 3 years now, and I do not feel like going back to the same old bro split, as my body feels way better working out like this."

Doing much weight training beyond that hurts us more than it helps us. We also know that 3-4 days per week are all that's needed to get the body of your dreams.\n \nSo, with all this new knowledge about duration and frequency of our workouts, we should all be growing like weeds with just those 3-4, one-hour training sessions per week, right?\n \nThis, of course, is not the case! Today, there are just as many frustrated lifters as there were 20 years ago, when gym rats spent 20 hours per week or more in their local box.\n \nMost\n bodybuilders hit plateaus, no matter how often they lift, because they don't want to change their routine\u2014comfort quickly leads to fewer gains.\n \nUsing an old pre-season football strategy of two-a-day workouts\u2014literally lifting twice in one day\u2014is a great way to mix up your routine, giving you better muscle and strength gains while helping to slash body fat.\n \nAnd no, you don't have to be in the NFL to do two-a-days!\n \nThis approach is great for anybody looking to make awesome gains on a tight schedule because, as it turns out, two 30-minute workouts are actually more productive than one 60-minute workout.\n \nAdvantages Of Two-A-Days\n \nOne of the greatest benefits of doing two-a-days lies in the obvious\u2014you're working out twice in one day and, hopefully, you're also eating two post - workout meals!\n \nBy working out twice, you get your protein synthesis and other anabolic systems racing. If you take full advantage of this by having two post-workout meals, you can start to see your gains skyrocket.\n \nYou will also find yourself able to train with more intensity.\n \nWhen faced with a full hour's worth of exercise, most of us subconsciously conserve our energy early on, so we don't find ourselves dragging through the latter portion of the workout. By splitting the total day's training between two sessions, intensity levels start and finish higher, which is key to new strength and muscle gains!\n \nAnd since you're fully ramped up for each workout, you'll burn more total calories than if the whole workout had been done at the same time.\n \nThe greater calorie deficit will offset the extra food being eaten, and the overall affect is more muscle with more fat burn\n \nHow To Do Two-A-Day Workouts\n \nTwo-A-Day Basics\n \nSome basic rules apply to all two-a-day programs.\n \nWhile you don't have to be exact with the timing, you need to allow at least six hours between the two workouts. If your workouts are much closer than this, you'll be too tired for optimal performance during round two.\n \nBecause of this, most people find it easiest to hit the gym in the morning before work and then catch another session after work. Going on your lunch break and then again in the evening also works well, as long as you've waited at least six hours.\n \nYou also have to make sure you limit your workouts to no more than 40 minutes in length, excluding the warm-up.\n \nAnd yes, it is very important for you to perform a proper warm-up and cool-down to speed up recovery, since you'll be back in the gym before the day is over!\n \nThe light, rhythmic exercise you get with a proper cool-down, such as 5-10 minutes of an easy aerobic activity like running, will help the heart to return the pooled blood trapped in the pumped-up muscles, speed up the removal of lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, and allow the muscles to lengthen again after the chronic contractions of a good lifting session.\n \nYou'll quickly get tired of two-a-days if you're constantly fatigued, so a quick and efficient recovery is the key to this program's success.\n \nTwo-A-Days Should Be Cycled\n \nSimply doing two random workouts in one day will quickly lead to overtraining and burnout. There's a proper way to structure your program so that you meet the increased energy demands and take full advantage of this unique fat-burning and muscle-building opportunity.\n \nDue to the intensity of training, these programs are best saved for busting through plateaus, or for those times when you're extremely motivated to work out and the idea of going to the gym that much sounds appealing.\n \nTo avoid overtraining, two-a-days should be cycled\u2014two weeks on, one week off\u2014or you'll burn out and, alas, plateau\u2014the very thing you'd hoped to overcome.\n \nTreat the two-a-day regime with respect, and it will respect you back!\n \nDesigning A Two-A-Day Program\n \nWhile there are plenty of ways to design your program, one of the most effective is lifting heavy in the first workout, then lighter in the second.\n \nThis lets you train your high-threshold muscle fibers\u2014the ones with the most strength and growth potential\u2014with a short, tough workout in the morning, while fitting in an evening workout that's easier but longer."

And it could also include \n10 minutes or so of aerobic exercise\n following your weight lifting - the stair climber, rowing machine, stationary bike or stepper machine - to be done AFTER your weight lifting workout.\n \nThis timeline does not include any stretching, dynamic or static. \nIf you\u2019re somebody who insists on stretching at the outset, then do only \ndynamic\n stretching. \nStatic\n stretching should only be done after the workout and ONLY for the muscles you worked on that day - no pain should be involved. You will have stretched your muscles on the gym floor anyway because lengthening and shortening a muscle is what movement is all about! Personally I NEVER stretch and certainly never with static stuff.\n \nExercise 4\u20136 days weekly and never over-train your muscles.\n That would mean that if you train your chest on one day, you would rest at least one day before doing the chest again - that allows those muscle to be repaired and rebuilt and to get stronger. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you can\u2019t exercise the day after your chest workout, just that it should involve another muscle group.\n \nYou can google tons of suggestions on this but an example with a 5-day schedule might be the following:\n \nDay 1 = quads, calves\n \nDay 2 = chest, triceps, anterior delts\n \nDay 3 = back, traps, abs\n \nDay 4 = hamstrings, calves\n \nDay 5 = chest, biceps, forearms\n \nFor more free tips and suggestions on diet and exercise, check out my videos on Instagram or YouTube.\n \nIG = \ncalorieburningat72\n \nYT = \nare you fat making or calorie burning?\n (same title as my upcoming book, Fall 2020)"

I have tried both and I found both to be effective.\n \nEven today, most of my workout is focused on the morning where I put in an average of 45 min to an hour. Some days, I get a window to go for walks or do short sprints in the evening and I go for it.\n \nWhat really matters here is consistency.

The former or latter? Whatever it is, no problem. Say hello to healthy lifestyle and a better body.\n \nThere are some unfortunate beings (like me) who doesn't get chance to workout in gym, but that's not at all an issue. You can do miraculous workouts at home like squats, lunges, skipping, cycling, yoga, etc. Remember one thing, your food intake should be at the best, if you workout twice a day. Drink plenty of water. Sleep very well.\n \nThere\n \nshall not be any excuses for excercise.\n \nCheers to healthy life! :-)"

You can easily do light-to-moderate aerobic work daily, and also a similar level of calisthenic exercises.\n \nBut if you were doing high-intensity work in either way\u2026.. You might run into the problem of overtraining.\n \nLikewise doing resistance work. (Weight training). When working with weights, your muscles need rest. Anywhere from 24 to 48 hours for each muscle group involved.\n \nAgain,\u201dovertraining\u201d is the likely result of too much work. You\u2019ll be continuously sore, feel tired yet have difficulty sleeping, and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019re not making any progress."

Engaging in daily workouts can also contribute to weight loss or weight maintenance, depending on your goals.\n \nExercise has been shown to have positive effects on mental health. Regular physical activity can reduce stress, improve mood, boost self-confidence, and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Consistent exercise can also improve your overall energy levels and stamina. Over time, your body becomes accustomed to physical exertion, and you may find that you have more energy throughout the day.\n \nIt's important to listen to your body, vary your workouts, and prioritize rest and recovery days to avoid overexertion and maintain a healthy balance. Consulting with a fitness professional or personal trainer can help you develop a safe and effective workout plan based on your goals and fitness level."

It will likely feel more fulfilling because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression BH reducing levels of stress hormones like Cortisol and Arsenal.\n \nOf course , all of those benefits depends on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week.\n \nA balanced diet is also Paramount to a healthy lifestyle.\n \nFor the average adult ages 18 to 64 , the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of 2.5 hours per week of moderately intense exercise like brisk walking or biking.\nOr, at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high intensity workouts like Running or Swimming sprints.\n \nOn top of that, make sure and take 2 days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training.\n \nThis will help your overall speed and endurance .\n \nAs you begin. Its important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast or you risk serious injury.\nYou will discover that the fitter you become, the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week, the week after, and so forth.\n \nExercise smart and often. And you will be running marathon in no time.\n \nIf you want to see few of my great answers on Quora like:\n \nHow to Lose weight without doing exercise?\nWhat are the best ways to lose weight?"

I never felt better or fitter all my life although I have previously also trained hard and of course built some muscles back then which were reactivated rather quicker now thanks to the effect called muscle-memory. But for some reason and maybe due corona I felt a wave or surge of energy this year which gave me a kick in the ass to get up and change my heavy overweight and do something about it.\n \nSo I started in February of this year with a weight of 111 kg and followed quite a strict trainings schedule which culminated after the lockdown in the summer in twice daily training sessions, namely early morning running for 6\u20138 km and every evenings of 90 minutes weights workouts. Sometimes I used even to combine running, bicycle tours (65km) and swimming(2km) altogether in one day. I ignored completely the common rest one day rule and all that is written and just listen to my body and curiously I found that the body is indeed capable of taking well care of itself and is asking me literally for being used and pushed to its limits daily, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t yet miss a single day of exercising at least once daily since then."

Here\u2019s an answer where I go in depth about this:\n \nLazar Nikolic's answer to What is the best way to build muscles at home?\n \nFirst of all, if you don\u2019t have a\n pull-up bar\n, these dumbbells might come in handy \u2013 curl variations (for biceps), dumbbell rows (narrow for lats, wider for rear delts) etc. But I highly suggest you try to save up for a pull-up bar, or at least find one in your neighborhood. Or use something else that\u2019s strong enough for you to hold onto. Pull-ups are one of the staples of bodyweight training.\n \nThis leads us to another point from the previous answer: muscles you can\u2019t easily target without equipment. \nCalves\n, for example, are used to the weight of your body, but using 20 kg of dumbbells as a resistance just might create initial overload. Don\u2019t try to exercise your \nmiddle delts\n with these, though. I\u2019m almost certain you won\u2019t be able to handle so much weight in a side lateral raise.\n \nBut, the beauty of dumbbells is this \u2013 you can make any exercise harder or easier with these. Let\u2019s take this paragraph from the linked answer:\nMix push-ups and dips for the chest, front shoulders and triceps\nMix pull-ups and chin-ups for lats, biceps, rear delts and the upper back\nMix variations of leg raises, planks and crunches for abs and obliques\nDo lower back extensions for the lower back (spinal erectors)\nMix hip thrusts and glute bridges for the gluteus\nMix squats and lunges for quads\nYou can put a dumbbell (or both) in a backpack and create more tension on \ndips\n, \npush-ups \nor a \nplank\n. You can use one or both in \nsquats\n and \nlunges\n easily. You can make both \nhip thrusts\n and \nglute bridges\n harder with dumbbell(s). And you can hold one or both while doing \ncrunches \nor even hold one of them between legs in \npull-ups\n and\n leg raises\n when you get strong enough.\n \nBut making things harder is in perspective, first you need to create a strong base and develop proper form if you intend on adding weight. That\u2019s where we start looking at things from a different perspective.\n \nIf \npush-ups\n are too hard, use dumbbells to do a \ndumbbell bench press\n. You don\u2019t even need a bench, lay on the floor.\n \nHandstand push-ups\n are one of the best shoulder building exercises. But that\u2019s way too hard, even for more experienced individuals. So, how to get there? Well, you can go through push-up progressions, but you can also strengthen these muscles doing \ndumbbell overhead press\n. In the beginning, use only one dumbbell and switch to both when you develop adequate strength. Just make sure you are familiar with proper form.\n \nIn the beginning, you probably won\u2019t be able to \ncurl \n10 kg effectively either. So, again \u2013 use only one dumbbell. If that\u2019s the case, that is.\n \nSo, in short \u2013 if you pair your two dumbbells with bodyweight training, you can definitely build more than enough muscle.\n \nI suggest you head off to \nAthlean-X\n YouTube channel and learn proper form of any exercise you want to do. You can also find great insight on \nCalisthenic Movement\n and\n FitnessFAQs\n YouTube channels.\n \nLearn new variations, both easier and harder, if you want to have a good, stable base for future training. Develop your whole body and stretch, so you don\u2019t injure yourself.\n \nDon\u2019t chase numbers, do your absolute best on every exercise and you\u2019ll have results. Just make sure that you can safely do anything you set your mind to. Again \u2013 \nstudy proper form in detail before attempting anything\n.\n \nGood luck!\n \nEDIT\n: In some other answers, people said that these dumbbells will eventually get too light for you. That certainly is true. But, with good \nbodyweight variations\n, you can mitigate this \u201cproblem\u201d. You can also change the way you move them in space \u2013\n slow down\n, do \none and a half rep\n style training, do \n21's technique\n and more. Yes, expanding your equipment inventory would be beneficial, but that\u2019s so far ahead of you that you don\u2019t have to worry about that now. Cheers!"

Today, there are just as many frustrated lifters as there were 20 years ago, when gym rats spent 20 hours per week or more in their local box.\n \nMost\n bodybuilders hit plateaus, no matter how often they lift, because they don't want to change their routine\u2014comfort quickly leads to fewer gains.\n \nUsing an old pre-season football strategy of two-a-day workouts\u2014literally lifting twice in one day\u2014is a great way to mix up your routine, giving you better muscle and strength gains while helping to slash body fat.\n \nAnd no, you don't have to be in the NFL to do two-a-days!\n \nThis approach is great for anybody looking to make awesome gains on a tight schedule because, as it turns out, two 30-minute workouts are actually more productive than one 60-minute workout.\n \nAdvantages Of Two-A-Days\n \nOne of the greatest benefits of doing two-a-days lies in the obvious\u2014you're working out twice in one day and, hopefully, you're also eating two post - workout meals!\n \nBy working out twice, you get your protein synthesis and other anabolic systems racing. If you take full advantage of this by having two post-workout meals, you can start to see your gains skyrocket.\n \nYou will also find yourself able to train with more intensity.\n \nWhen faced with a full hour's worth of exercise, most of us subconsciously conserve our energy early on, so we don't find ourselves dragging through the latter portion of the workout. By splitting the total day's training between two sessions, intensity levels start and finish higher, which is key to new strength and muscle gains!\n \nAnd since you're fully ramped up for each workout, you'll burn more total calories than if the whole workout had been done at the same time.\n \nThe greater calorie deficit will offset the extra food being eaten, and the overall affect is more muscle with more fat burn\n \nHow To Do Two-A-Day Workouts\n \nTwo-A-Day Basics\n \nSome basic rules apply to all two-a-day programs.\n \nWhile you don't have to be exact with the timing, you need to allow at least six hours between the two workouts. If your workouts are much closer than this, you'll be too tired for optimal performance during round two.\n \nBecause of this, most people find it easiest to hit the gym in the morning before work and then catch another session after work. Going on your lunch break and then again in the evening also works well, as long as you've waited at least six hours.\n \nYou also have to make sure you limit your workouts to no more than 40 minutes in length, excluding the warm-up.\n \nAnd yes, it is very important for you to perform a proper warm-up and cool-down to speed up recovery, since you'll be back in the gym before the day is over!\n \nThe light, rhythmic exercise you get with a proper cool-down, such as 5-10 minutes of an easy aerobic activity like running, will help the heart to return the pooled blood trapped in the pumped-up muscles, speed up the removal of lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, and allow the muscles to lengthen again after the chronic contractions of a good lifting session.\n \nYou'll quickly get tired of two-a-days if you're constantly fatigued, so a quick and efficient recovery is the key to this program's success.\n \nTwo-A-Days Should Be Cycled\n \nSimply doing two random workouts in one day will quickly lead to overtraining and burnout. There's a proper way to structure your program so that you meet the increased energy demands and take full advantage of this unique fat-burning and muscle-building opportunity.\n \nDue to the intensity of training, these programs are best saved for busting through plateaus, or for those times when you're extremely motivated to work out and the idea of going to the gym that much sounds appealing.\n \nTo avoid overtraining, two-a-days should be cycled\u2014two weeks on, one week off\u2014or you'll burn out and, alas, plateau\u2014the very thing you'd hoped to overcome.\n \nTreat the two-a-day regime with respect, and it will respect you back!\n \nDesigning A Two-A-Day Program\n \nWhile there are plenty of ways to design your program, one of the most effective is lifting heavy in the first workout, then lighter in the second.\n \nThis lets you train your high-threshold muscle fibers\u2014the ones with the most strength and growth potential\u2014with a short, tough workout in the morning, while fitting in an evening workout that's easier but longer."

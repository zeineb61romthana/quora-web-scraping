Cardio exercises are important for heart and lungs , which you can\u2019t skip. 20 high Jumps , Running , jogging is preferred.\nStretches : I strongly recommend having emphasis on maximum body stretches, it\u2019ll increase your functionality in upcoming exercises.\nPush Ups : Keep your hands at same distance as broad as your shoulder width for starters , at least 20 push ups recommended but don't be disappointed if you can\u2019t . It isn't because you are weak it is because you are not in practice.Also Push Ups with less distance between your hands = Good for triceps and shoulders , Push Ups with more gap between your hands = Good for chest . Including 2\u20133 types of Push Ups recommended.\nPull Ups : Have a bar and do as much pull ups exercise as you can , and if you can\u2019t just try again and again . You will increase repetations eventually with time .\nWeight exercises : If you have weights, biceps curls and shoulder press exercises are adviced . Weight training is important part of workout routine but it optional in the start and you can include it in your routine in future.\nImportant Tips :\nDon\u2019t include too much exercises in the start. More than one exercise for single body part won't make that muscle making process shorter but will exhaust your energy and time.\nStart from your efficiency with less exercises in beginning and increase repetitions and exercises with time.\nDon't think about the result , Trust the process!!!. Enjoy workout routine and only include exercise that you like. (For beginners) . (We don't want our body to get tired early of the routine.)\nYou don't need protein powder or any extra supplement apart from the daily food you get. Just eat much you want but there should be 4\u20135 hours at least gap between workout time and food time. Eat any junk food much you want but remember once in a month, don't eat on regular basis . It makes you lazy .\nMost important thing is \u201cRest\u201d. Do take 8 hours sleep at least . Do Workout 4 days a week . Remember your don't get muscle in workout time but it builds muscle when you sleeping.\nStart today, be consistent. Good wishes to you .\n \nDo up vote the answer if it helped.\n \nPic Source : Google images."

Soon your body well get use to your body weight and will become easy.\n \n3. CHIN UP: Chin up is a little different from pull ups. Here ur palms are facing towards u and the gap between two hand is less and arms are parallel to each other unlike in pull up position where arms form a V shape. This focuses on \nBICEPS, FOREARMS, BACK.\n \n4. PUSH UP: This is one of the basic exercise for upper body. U can change hand position to apply focus on different parts.\n \n-- WIDE GRIP : Focuses on CHEST, BICEPS\n-- CLOSE GRIP : Focuses on CHEST, TRICEPS\n \nU can increase the intensity of workout by making it difficult by keeping ur legs on elevated platform.\n \n5. BICYCLE CRUNCH : Best for abdomen. U can google it to see how it is done.\n \n6. PLANK : Its a really challenging exercise requires mental stamina. Hold on to it as long as u can and every day try to beat ur previous target. focuses on ABDOMEN, BACK, SHOULDERS.\n \n7. -- SIT UPS : For upper abs \n -- LEG RAISE : For lower abs\n \n8. SQUATS : Squats with hands behind ur head is very good for THIGHS, HIPS.\nIts word be better if u have some weight on urself to increase intensity.\n \n9. CALF RAISES: Standing on ur toes and coming back. Its best if u have some weight on.\n \nThese exercise will cover almost all major body parts and u can do them separately day wise or mix it up as u like it.\n \nDIET : Diet is vey important part of working out. Remember its not the exercise but the food which makes u grow. \n- As u have mentioned you are skinny then make it a point to eat a lot.\n- No need to take supplements coz working out at home wont require that much.\n- Increase number of meal and don't stay hungry. Eat after every four hours.

Or use your watch to stop the time (you\u2019ll try to beat the time you recorded).\n \nAs soon as you hit \u201cstart\u201d and the clock is ticking, you\u2019ll perform 200 push-ups, 250 squats and 100 towell pullups as fast as possible (with excellent form, obviously).\n \nOf course you shouldn\u2019t bang out all 200 push-ups, 250 squats and 100 pullups all in one set!\n \nDivide the work up, so that you DON\u2019T go to muscular failure on each and every set! That\u2019s really important, or else you\u2019ll burn out.\n \nWhat I do, for example, is that I do sets of 20 on push-up (so 10 sets per \u201cround\u201d), 25\u201350 reps on squats, 5\u201310 reps on pullups.\n \nFind a set and rep scheme that works for you. Again, you SHOULD NOT go to muscular failure in each and ever set. Keep 2\u20133 reps in the tank.\n \nWith that said, the key do these type of workouts, is to rest as little as possible (remember you\u2019re doing this for time).\n \nI always hit a set of push-ups, immediately followed by a set of squats and then, without rest, I bang out my pullups. Then I\u2019ll rest for 45\u201360sec. Only to start the next set.\n \nTrust me, your heart rate will jack the heck up on this routine!\n \nYou don\u2019t have to run any additional cardio with this and you\u2019ll develop a very \u201cfunctional\u201d type of strength endurance if you stick to it.\n \nOh, and you\u2019ll also build some lean muscle! Especially if you haven\u2019t used these type of \u201cprison cell workouts\u201d in the past.\n \nBut make no mistake\u2026This is not for the faint of heart.\n \nIf you need help with this routine, then shoot me a DM or comment down below!\n \nAll the best and I\u2019m rooting for you,\n \nMattis Rogers"

Again, aim for 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions.\n \n- Dumbbells or household objects: If you have access to dumbbells or household objects like water bottles or cans, you can use them for exercises like dumbbell rows, shoulder presses, goblet squats, and lunges.\n \n3. Cardiovascular exercise: Include some form of cardio to improve your cardiovascular fitness and burn calories. You can choose activities like jogging or running in place, jumping rope, high knees, or dancing. Perform cardio exercises for 20-30 minutes, aiming for moderate to high intensity.\n \n4. Core exercises: Strengthen your core with exercises like planks, mountain climbers, Russian twists, and bicycle crunches. Include 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise.\n \n5. Flexibility work: Finish your routine with some stretching exercises to improve flexibility and prevent muscle tightness. Focus on stretches for major muscle groups, including your legs, hips, back, shoulders, and chest. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds.\n \n6. Rest and recovery: Allow your body time to rest and recover between workout sessions. Aim for at least one day of rest per week to prevent overtraining and promote muscle growth.\n \nRemember, it's important to start with exercises that match your current fitness level and gradually increase intensity and resistance as you get stronger. Additionally, consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions."

Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent. Extend your legs back so you are balanced on your hands and toes, your feet hip-width apart. Once in this position, here is how you will do a push-up.\nContract your abs and tighten your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine.\nInhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself to the floor, until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.\nExhale while contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands, returning to the start position.\n2. Glute Bridge\n \nA glute bridge is an exercise that can be used to target the gluteal muscles. It is often seen in warm up segments or strength/accessory training segments to increase glute activation, strength, and muscle hypertrophy.\n \nHow To Do It:\nLie face up on the floor, with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Keep your arms at your side with your palms down.\nLift your hips off the ground until your knees, hips and shoulders form a straight line. Squeeze those glutes hard and keep your abs drawn in so you don\u2019t overextend your back during the exercise.\nHold your bridged position for a couple of seconds before easing back down.\n3. Toe-touch\n \nStrengthen your abdominal muscles with an exercise that combines the toe touch and the crunch and is sometimes referred to as the toe-touch crunch, or the vertical toe touch.The toe touching ab exercise primarily trains your rectus abdominis -- the muscle that makes up your six-pack. Your core, however, includes your side obliques, transverse abdominis, back stabilizers and pelvic floor.\n \nHow To Do It:\nLie on your back with your palms down by your sides. Bend your knees and bring them toward your torso, then slowly start to straighten your legs. They should ultimately end up perpendicular to the ground.\nLift your arms. While exhaling, slowly roll your shoulders up off the mat, reaching towards your toes. Round your shoulders forward (but keep them down) to create a concave shape with your torso. Your lower back should stay on the ground, but don\u2019t press it into the floor \u2014 that\u2019ll flatten the natural curve of your lower back and take you out of the correct position.\nInhale as you lower back down. When you reach the ground, keep the tension in your abs firing. In other words, don\u2019t just relax on the mat. That's one rep.\nThis video that I watched has really helped me out and goes indebt"

Then you just have to do the push, which will be hard, but give it 100% and then stop and reset as needed.\n \nNext, bodyweight squats. Sit on a kitchen chair, or the toilet, or a comfortable chair if you really want to. Without using your arms, lean forward and stand up. Once you are fully upright, sit back down again but do not let your weight sink into the chair - just sit down until you feel contact between your body and the material of the seat. Now stand up again. Remember, no hands! Also, your feet should not move at all. Repeat for 10 reps per set, 3 sets.\n \nLunges - from a standing position, take a step forward with one foot. Drive your front knee forward and bend it, until your hip is as close to the heel of your front foot as you can manage, ideally with your rear leg being straight. Now move back up to your starting position and repeat the motion with the other leg. Repeat 10 times per set, for 3 sets.\n \nAs a beginner workout routine, that would usually be enough to start with."

If you don't have dumbbells just pick-up heavy stuff with handles (4L milk jug filled with water, rocks or sand)\n \nP - Pull-ups - You can get a pull-up bar that goes across a door frame for relatively cheap at Walmart. The bar will usually have different handles so you are able to switch between chin-ups, pull-ups and neutral grip pull-ups.\n \nExample Rep scheme: Try adding 1 additional rep every time you do this workout.\n \nPull-up - 10 reps\nReverse lunge with no additional weight - 10 reps with each leg\nPush-up - 10 reps\n \nIf you can only do 3 pull-ups at a time break it up. Do 2 pull-ups and rest for 30\u201360 seconds and repeat until you get to the desired number.\n \nOnce you start getting into the 30 rep per exercise area change up the exercises and start back at 10.\n \nThese three exercises are a good place to get started when doing a workout at home. They work most of the primary muscle groups and will give you a good base strength.\n \nHere is an article that goes more in-depth :)\n \nhttps://www.t-nation.com/training/plp-the-60-day-challenge"

Super affordable and a great resource that I use until today.\n \nIf you\u2019re trying to bulk up and put on muscle fast, invest in Creatine Monohydrate, and then probably Whey Protein (I prefer concentrate as it has more immunological benefits, but if your sensitive to milk, try Isolate). If you\u2019re trying to put on size, you need to be eating 1g to 1.5 g of protein/per lb of bodyweight (example: 100lb male needs to ingest 100g-150g of protein/daily). I\u2019d try eating 30gr of protein immediately within 30 minutes of waking up (see Tim Ferriss\u2019s 4 hour Body book for more info regarding that.\n \nAlso just challenge yourself in new ways. Try gymnastic moves like handstands, try perfecting a perfect 15 second handstand hold. Or construct your own parrallete bars out of PVC pipes, and practice doing an L-sit hold. These isometric types of exercises are great for the home gym lifter, and will tax you in a ways you\u2019re not used to. Something that is severely overlooked in weightlifting is grip strength. A great thing to do so simple, but would be just hanging for a pull-up bar as long as you could. Improved grip strength will improve all your other lifts such as pull-ups, dips, etc."

Upper body strength training (15-20 minutes):\n \na) Push-ups: Perform 3 sets of 12 reps for chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n \nb) Dips: Use a sturdy chair or elevated surface to perform 3 sets of 10 reps for triceps and chest.\n \nc) Superman Pose: Lie face down on the floor with arms extended forward; lift your chest off the ground along with your legs simultaneously. Do 3 sets of 15 reps to target back muscles.\n \n3. Lower body strength training (15-20 minutes):\n \na) Squats: Stand with feet hip-width apart and lower into a sitting position while keeping your weight on heels; do 4 sets of 12 reps for glutes, quads, hamstrings.\n \nb) Lunges: Step forward with one foot until both knees are at a right angle then push back up; repeat alternating legs for a total of 3 sets of 12 reps per leg focusing on glutes and quads.c) Calf raises: Stand on an elevated surface like stairs or use dumbbells if available; perform calf raises by raising heels as high as possible then lowering them below the step level. Aim for three sets of fifteen repetitions.\n \n4. Core exercises (10-15 minutes):\n \na) Plank: Assume push-up position but rest forearms instead of palms on the ground; hold this position engaging core muscles for three sets lasting thirty seconds each.\n \nb) Bicycle crunches: Lie flat on your back with hands behind head, bring one knee towards your chest while simultaneously touching it with the opposite elbow. Repeat for 3 sets of 15 reps per side to engage abs and obliques.\n \nc) Russian twists: Sit on the floor with knees bent and feet elevated off the ground; twist your torso from side to side, touching hands to the ground each time. Aim for three sets of twenty repetitions.\n \n5. Cardiovascular exercise (20-30 minutes):Choose activities that elevate heart rate such as jumping rope, jogging in place, or performing high-intensity interval training exercises like burpees or mountain climbers. Alternate between high-intensity bursts and short rest periods for an effective cardio workout.\n \n6. Cool-down & Stretching (5-10 minutes):\n \nFinish your routine by gradually slowing down movements and stretching major muscle groups like hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, shoulders, and chest.Remember to stay hydrated throughout your workout routine by drinking water regularly. Modify exercises based on fitness levels and always listen to your body's signals - if any pain or discomfort arises during a particular exercise, consult a professional before continuing.

Put your workout clothes shoes and water bottle all right next to your home office space. Consider even wearing your workout clothes while you work. That way you\u2019ll have fewer excuses to carve out the time for an at-home workout.\n3. The Best Free Resources for Working Out from Home\n \nRight now there are countless free workout routines available for you to stream from anywhere. Check with your regular gym, or use my free YouTube videos. If you are hypermobile, check out our Spoonie Resources page too for links to many Hypermobility specialists.\n \n4. Create Your Own Workout\n \nTake some time to engage your mind and get creative with your workout from home routine. Create your own workout routine with these easy steps:\n \nPick 9 exercises in a row that use equipment you have in your home. If you don\u2019t have any equipment, pick bodyweight exercises.\n \nPick an exercise for your upper body core and lower body. Three of each works nicely\n \nDo 8 to 12 reps of each and move on to the next one with just a 10-second break. Work your way through the list 3 to 5 times.\n \nRepeat 3 times a week.\n \n5. Go for a Daily Walk or Jog\n \nGetting outside is extremely important while you\u2019re limited to leaving your house. Find time to go for a daily walk or jog. If you\u2019re walking, bring 1 to 2-pound hand weights with you avoid using ankle weights, which cause unnecessary strain on your knees and hips. Do speed intervals by speed walking or lightly jogging for one minute then at a normal pace for 2 to 3 minutes.\n \nIf you\u2019re a jogger do the same thing, except don\u2019t choke the weights. Hold them as loosely as possible in your hand.\n6. Get Creative\n \nKeep your workouts fresh by switching up your routine. Change your walking route mix and match exercises and use an app once a week. Find a unique blend of different exercises that works for you. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment a little bit here. Try working out during different times of the day or opt to try a new way of exercising. Take advantage of the freedom you have to set your schedule from home and make the most out of a less-than-ideal situation.\n \n7. Go for HSD/EDS Safe Exercise Apps\n \nRight now there are a lot of fitness apps that are offering at-home workout routines for free. But most of these are not safe for hypermobile persons. These apps are specifically designed to have safer exercises for persons with unstable bodies. A few of my favorites are:\n \nThe Zebra Club - by Jeanie Di Bon\n \nPhysioEd\n8. Split Everything into Small Breaks\n \nIf you're juggling kids at home a spouse who\u2019s got a lot of conference calls and a million tasks piling up with your work and life we hear you. Seriously. This is A LOT to take on at the moment and exercising at home might be the last thing on your mind especially when you\u2019re low on spoons. There are certainly ways to carve out time for a workout from home routine.\n \nInstead of trying to get a 30-minute block in, split it up into smaller intervals. Do a work task and then take 3 minutes for a single exercise. If you use this method, use a low-load with little to no extra weight. Without being warmed up it\u2019s unsafe to add weights to your exercise.\n \n9. Take Your At-Home Workout Outdoors\n \nOne way to make your workout from home routine successful is to move your workout outdoors. If you have an outdoor space set up your laptop or phone outdoors for a workout full of Vitamin D. This is a great way to not only work out from home but boost your immunity too. Sunshine boosts your mood and the fresh air is good for your soul. Not to mention that Vitamin D3 is vital for a healthy immune system."

This is the most basic requirement.\n \nThe next is to improve your cardiovascular capacity. The result will be you are working at a lower heart rate than before. Less stress on the heart.\n \nThen you should also work on agility and balance. This will regain back the spring in your step as you grow old and move around flat footed. You are also less likely to fall and hurt yourself.\n \nThe two main muscle groups used daily are the lower body and the upper body pulling action. The third group is the upper body pushing action. Very seldom used but you can also do the workout if you want to.\n \nForget all the various types of workouts you can do. Just stick to the simplest that you can groove in and do in your sleep.\n \nThe body weight squat is sufficient for the lower body strength. There is also the need to increase stair climbing ability and endurance. A low stool is a good point to start. Then onto a sturdy chair as you improve. Do this in conjunction with the body squat. It prepares the body when you switch from walking and then climbing stairs.\n \nLower back extensions will cover the upper body pulling action. The most basic is bending forward while trying to touch the toes and then straightening up. It sounds simple but it is NOT. The SPINE must be kept in the neutral position ALL the time. It forces the lower back muscles to do most of the work and thus you will get the proper adaptation. A more advanced and more strength adaptation workout is in the image below.\nPull ups will build arm and related muscles.\n \nPush ups are enough for the pushing group of muscles.\n \nThe agility, balance and cardiovascular part is taken care of by doing rope skipping or rope jumping, whatever the term. For the average person, it is equivalent to running for the same length of time in terms of energy usage if you are looking at weight loss as well.\n \nThe only problem you will face is that it is NOT easy at first. If you target say 30 minutes, I doubt you can even do the two leg version for 10 minutes. Your legs will start to burn. That is the alert to stop. Just do the one leg after the other version at slow speed. Stop and rest when you are alerted. Then continue until you reach the 30 minutes. As you improve, increase speed and slowly build up until you can do the two leg version continously for your target duration. Rope skipping, especially on two legs involve the toes, the ankles and calves mainly. The thigh muscle do only a bit of work. Hardly any stress on the knees as the angle of bend is small. So no fear of knee injury.\n \nNot much more to add except to point out a few things. The rope skipping will most probably bring you up to around 80% of max. This is because you are working at just below the leg burning stage. That level is enough for a fairly high level of cardiovascular adaptation if done for a long enough duration and period. How you schedule your workouts and whether to mix them together in a single session, I leave to you."

Push-ups are your best friend here; aim for 3 sets of 10-15 reps. Need something for those triceps? Grab a chair or use an elevated surface for tricep dips, doing 3 sets of 10-15 reps. Don't forget about your core \u2013 plank variations like the standard plank, side plank, and plank with shoulder taps are excellent choices (hold each for 30-60 seconds).\n \nTime to work those legs! Body-weight squats are fantastic; aim for 3 sets of 15-20 reps. Throw in some lunges (forward or reverse) with 3 sets of 10 reps for each leg. Want to activate those glutes? Try glute bridges or hip thrusts, doing 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n \nLet's give some love to your core muscles. Bicycle crunches (3 sets of 15-20 reps each side) and Russian twists (3 sets of 15-20 reps each side) are great picks. Finish off with leg raises or flutter kicks for 3 sets of 15-20 reps.\n \nFeeling energetic? Add some cardio or high-intensity moves like jump squats, burpees (3 sets of 8-10 reps), and mountain climbers (3 sets of 30-45 seconds).\n \nFinally, cool down with a slow jog or walk in place. Stretch out those muscles with gentle stretches for your hamstrings, quads, calves, chest, back, and shoulders.\n \nRemember, listen to your body, take breaks when needed, and stay hydrated throughout your workout!"

If you want to be stronger, start with bodyweight exercises and add weights when you want to increase your size and strength.\n \nFor the time-strapped, I recommend the rowing machine. 20 minutes a day on that thing will keep you in great shape."

The best is to go online and see what fits your fitness level or contact a professional Trainer.

Make sure to think about what body parts you want to focus on for example (abs) you\u2019d be doing planks/crunches etc. Dedicate a space where you want to get in shape and listen to something you enjoy to keep you motivated. Create goals for yourself and have good strategies to work your way in achieving it, consistently taking small steps will build up and hopefully you will get in shape! Good luck!"

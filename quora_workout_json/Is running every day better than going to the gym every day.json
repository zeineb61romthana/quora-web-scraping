But if you run in addition to doing other things, then it's probably better.\n \nAt a bear minimum, doing something, will always be better than doing nothing, so always do first and foremost what you can do. Once you\u2019ve got that down though, make sure you do a little variety of things.\n \nAt this point, ideally participate in at least one activity that:\nChallenges your heart (\na cardiovascular endurance activity like running\n)\nChallenges your range of motion (\nmobility/flexibility training\n)\nChallenges your neuromuscular system to produce force (\nlift, jump, etc\u2026challenge your bones, tendons, and muscles\n)"

Maybe the first question is \u201cWhy should one use an IDE at all?\u201d\n \nAn IDE can help you code faster and become much more productive if you devote some time to learning the tool in the first place. \u201cWhat is an IDE?\u201d, you might ask. IDEs integrate multiple development tools, including a code editor, version control systems, a debugger, run configurations, a terminal, database tooling, and much more.\n \nAs an IDE for Python and other languages, PyCharm gives you \nhighly accurate code completion \nthat helps you write less code and avoid bugs. With its \nsmart code navigation\n, you can quickly navigate around your code to inspect, for instance, the implementation of a class you are about to instantiate. PyCharm\u2019s \nproject-wide refactorings\n will ensure you won\u2019t break any code when, for instance, renaming a variable or changing a method signature, and much more.\n \nTogether, all this makes you more productive as a developer and increases your overall ergonomics. When using PyCharm, you can avoid writing boilerplate code over and over again, feel more confident when exploring code bases, and have the ability to work with technologies you are not fully experienced with.\n \nPyCharm comes in two editions. The free and open-source Community Edition is designed for Python development only. The paid Professional Edition offers support for remote interpreters, frontend technologies including popular JavaScript frameworks, databases (SQL and noSQL), and Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask, and FastAPI.\n \nSome people say IDEs have a tough learning curve. It\u2019s true that you will need to devote some time to learning the shortcuts and commands and configuring your environment to get the most from using PyCharm. Be aware, though, that unlike some other IDEs on the market, PyCharm has everything you need to start coding \u2013 right out of the box.\n \nThe good news is that you can try PyCharm Professional for 30 days, completely free of charge. \nDownload PyCharm\n and see if it works for you!"

So, for example, run one day, lift weights the next, do yoga the next and kickboxing the next. By keeping your body guessing, you'll avoid plateaus and continue to make gains week-in and week-out.\n \nHope this helps!

I can't tell you that you won't see your results peak at some point if you vary your workouts, but it is less likely to happen across ALL workouts at the SAME TIME.\nInjury\n - If you keep forcing your body to do the same sets of exercises over and over again, it will eventually break down. I vaguely understood this point in my 20s, I fully embrace it now in my...slightly older age. ;)\nMaximum Benefits\n - Speaking in general terms, long distance running helps with endurance and efficiency. Sprinting guards against the loss of muscle mass and provides explosion. Weightlifting helps build/tone muscle mass and can speed up metabolism. Yoga and pilates provide flexibility and balance.\ntl;dr\n \nIf you can find a way to add multiple elements into your workout routine, you will be better off.\n \nEDIT: Always find nits after I hit \"submit.\""

Each milestone (10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 100, 200, 300, 365 days) gives a huge mental boost. The first 100 are the hardest, but then it feels easy.\nWho You Run With: \nNever run alone. If you are not running with a friend or a run club, listen to your favorite artist for motivation. Create a Spotify playlist that makes you want to dance. Runners and Artists give you energy.\nWhat to Prep: \nSet your shoes and clothes out the night before your run. If you run in the morning, set it in your room so you see it right when you wake up. If you run at night, pack your clothes and shoes the day before in a gym bag.\nWhere to Run\n: Create a portfolio of your favorite routes near your home or work. Where have you already been training? You know these tracks, trails and streets like your own home, so you are confident going into these runs.\nWhen to Run\n: Run at the same time everyday. Block out the time on your schedule when it is the best time for you to run. The more consistent you are, the easier this gets. If your health is a priority, do it first thing in the morning every day after waking up so there are no excuses.\nListen to your Body\n: You will know your body better than anyone if you built a base first. Recovery is key. If you aren\u2019t recovering between runs, then walk. Go back to the foundations. Easy days, healthy nutrition, and adequate sleep are the foundation.\nWhy Do You Run\n: There will be days that are going to be hard. Shitty weather. Low energy. Always remember why you started and who you are running for. We get to run."

Whereas weight training in the gym will help you build muscular strength and endurance. So combining both of them in your lifestyle is a better option in my opinion. It will help you get better body composition. Some people do cardio and weight training on alternate days in a week. So do whatever option suits you as per your goal."

I thought that by signing up I\u2019ll be forced to go and practice, but I was completely wrong.\n \nSlowly, day by day, the run came closer and closer, and yet, other than a couple of runs here and there I still couldn\u2019t get myself out to run. Finally, t\nhe day of the run arrived, and I still had never run 10km in my life before.\n \nSo there I was, at the start line, for an activity I don\u2019t like and was completely unprepared for.\n \nThe run was tiring, but not too bad. I stopped only twice. At the beginning of the run, I was disgruntled and annoyed that I had ever signed myself up. By a quarter of the way through, I had accepted my fate. And by halfway, I was enjoying it. I ended up finishing the first 10km run in my life in less than one hour.\n \nAfter the run was over, I realised that \nrunning isn\u2019t so bad after all. It\u2019s the mental barrier that gives the biggest block.\n \nSince that day, I\u2019ve been running 4\u20135 times a week.\n \nYou can easily search up the scientific benefits of running, but here\u2019s what I can tell you from personal experience:\n \nWhen I run, I get the best ideas\n \nIt\u2019s a great, almost meditative escape from today\u2019s constant notifications and distractions\n \nAfter running, I feel great, awake, and energised, not to mention focused\n \nIt\u2019s an activity that you begin to enjoy that you can feel proud of, unlike things like gaming/watching TV\n \nSo if you\u2019re wondering whether to take the plunge and start running, I\u2019d give a resounding YES, because it\u2019s one of the best activities I\u2019ve started in a long time."

I love running too and he showed me it is possible. So, I told myself: \"One day, every day\"\n \nCautionary Tale from my First Attempt:\n \nThe first time I tried to streak was back in May 2020. Covid-19 shut down all the gyms, so \nrunning was my routine.\n I was doing well until Day 59 of the streak.\n \nThat morning, I remember \nfeeling physically and mentally exhausted\n before going out the run. My fatigue usually goes away after the first two miles, so I thought I would be good.\n \nI was running a different route through my city and side-stepped onto the gravel. My shoe kept sliding right over the gravel and I felt a pop. My ankle turned into a balloon!\n \nI could have avoided this misstep if I listened to my body. I was out for a few weeks after that.\n \nAnd so it goes.\n \nWhy I tried again:\n \nI have a strong motivation to \nmake fitness an unbreakable habit\n. After a few months of not being consistent with exercise, I was tired of making excuses. I decided to run first thing every morning before work.\n \nI asked myself three questions:\nWhy do I want to do this?\n Running is my favorite thing to do. The rush I get after a run helps me get through my day. The days when I wouldn't run I felt off mentally. I want to share that it is possible and inspire people to find a fitness habit that they love to do every day too.\nHow do I know I can do this?\n I had already been running for a long time. I have a base level of fitness. Covid-19 let me focus more on running and working remotely gave me more time. All I needed to do was balance harder runs with mostly easy recovery runs each week.\nWhat is my minimum?\n One mile a day. Even if I'm traveling or off the routine, I know I can fit one mile in. Make it easy.\nTips that worked for me:\nBuild a foundation \nof easy running over months or years before you start a run streak and keep easy days easy!\nThe first 100 days are the challenge\n. Each milestone (30, 60, 90, 100, 200, 300, 365 days) gives a huge mental boost to keep going. After 100, it becomes less physical and more mental.\nFollow Hellah Sedibe and thousands of runners\n who have been running every day (check out the 4000+ runners streaking on \nruneveryday\n Some have been doing it for 50+ years).\nIt feels good to start the day with a run. Good luck and stay healthy! \ud83d\ude4f\n \nEdit:\n \nI just wrote about \nhow to exercise every day\n after hitting Day 500. Check it out :)"

If one focuses too much on running, the body may start looking ultra thin and one may suffer from injuries like knee problems and back problems. If one focuses too much on gym and weight training, there is risk of losing stamina and cardio strength.\n \nHence, an ideal mix of cardio exercises like running and moderate weight training is the best solution. In my view, unless you are training for a marathon, you can maintain stamina by running 22-25KM a week over three running sessions and doing other exercises on the remaining days. I would suggest the following weekly routine:\n \nSunday - long run - 12 km at steady pace withing 75-80minutes.\n \nMonday - rest\n \nTuesday - weights training at gym - cover biceps and back muscles\n \nWednesday - short run - 5km - at your best speed.\n \nThursday - weights training at gym - legs and triceps\n \nFriday - Medium run -7km - run at medium n brisk pace alternately\n \nSaturday - weights training at gym - shoulders and chest\n \nI have followed similar schedule for many years.

I don\u2019t know any really competitive runners who train less than 7 days a week. There are occasional exceptions to the rule but generally, top high school,collegiate, professional, masters or just really competitive distance runners train every day. The total volume of miles is a key factor in performance improvement so if your volume of miles goes up and you sustain it for a long period of time, your cardio performance will improve.\nAnd also, I\u2019m tired of the body shaming BS about a runner\u2019s physique.

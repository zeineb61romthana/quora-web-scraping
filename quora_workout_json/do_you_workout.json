At 6 pm. That\u2019s when I start lifting, I don\u2019t have my own dumbbells/weights, so I use my tenant\u2019s (I have permission to). Simple, easy lifting, I don\u2019t know how much the weight is but I am just 13, so it\u2019s not so much. I lift for 30 mins - 1 hr. Then I take my dog for a walk, after walking my dog, I put her back inside and go to jog. First several seconds I brisk walk, then I walk a bit faster, after, once I\u2019ve reached the end of the sidewalk, where I must turn right to continue onto the sidewalk, I start to jog, once I\u2019ve crossed another patch of the roads, I start to run, then jog, then brisk walk, then just walk. Sometimes I try and run the whole way, but it usually doesn't work.\n \nAfter that, I head back inside, by the time I\u2019m back, it\u2019s usually late (around 7:40 or 8:15 pm), still, I continue to exercise, Russian twists, jumping jacks, squats, push-ups (modified), stretching, etc\u2026\n \nIt feels nice to use the energy I have after school instead of sitting around and playing video games until 12 am, that\u2019s what I used to do, but once I realized just how important my health is, I started working out. You can use this schedule too, but if you don\u2019t have dumbbells/weights, I recommend using filled milk cartons or something heavy which you can grasp and lift. I am also thinking about getting a gym membership and a gym nearby, so maybe get one of those, they cost money but it\u2019s worth it."

My rest is the day when I don\u2019t feel like training and that does not mean I am cheating. The only reason my routine is not perfect is because I need a permanent rest day. Everyday I wake up I feel like working my ass off. Even in those days when my body feels like it can not move. Rest day is the greatest punishment for me."

While it is cheaper to work out at home or outside, the routines I can do on weight machines at a gym are far more beneficial to me than anything I\u2019ve been able to do on my own. I like the benefits of being able to explore different classes and try new kinds of workouts. My gym also has a pretty great community of people who exercise around the same time, and it\u2019s nice to have people hold me accountable."

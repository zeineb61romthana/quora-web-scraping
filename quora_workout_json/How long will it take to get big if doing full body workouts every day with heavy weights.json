You have to commit to a schedule and time your workouts, prioritize weaker muscle groups when you see that there is an imbalance, and take rest days. With persistence and high tolerance to pain you can get big within a couple years, given that you eat protein everyday and prioritize mass over lean physique.\n \nHowever, it's hard to assume but it remember that you are crafting marble and this is an art."

But after a few weeks, your strength will increase, and you will find yourself getting worn out. If you what to gain mass, you need to focus on individual parts of your body. It also depends if you want to be a body builder or just get big a strong. If you want to get big, just do compound movements, like squats, deadlifts, bench press and rowing movements for your back. Basically you are working your largest muscles, that will work you hard and burn \ud83d\udd25 calories, and condition your cardio respiratory system. Even if you want to become a body builder, I believe that's where you would start. The smaller muscles with automatically grow because of the metabolic boost from working these large muscles. Do this for about 6 months. But always remember to learn the proper form for any movements you do. Go very light and build up. Squats for example, take some time to get comfortable doing. Do not rush to get huge. Safety and consistency and great nutrition, and make sure you are fully recovered between workouts. The growth and strength increases happen out of the gym. After six months, reevaluate, if you want to become a body builder, you can start doing your smaller muscles, like triceps, biceps, shoulders, forearms and calfs. One other very important caveat, learn to stretch your muscles after your workouts, not before. If you do not stretch regularly, our bodies get tight as we age and it leads to joint problems etc. I love to do zone 2 training on a bike or stationary bike, or I use the stair machine. Zone 2 is under the lactate threshold. Which means you can carry on a conversion for a couple of sentences but no so easy that you could sing a song. I use a heart rate monitor since the first came out I believe in the late eighties. I am 64, I have been doing fitness for 35 years consistently. I hope this helps you with your focus to have a plan and a goal for every workout you do. And never give it up throughout your life. It is one one the greatest gifts to yourself. I will not say good luck, I don't believe in luck, I believe in our greatest gift, our mind."

By hitting each muscle 3 times a week but giving your body more rest overall allows more muscle growth. Also I used to waste a lot of time working on isolation exercises and wasn't doing much the second half of the workouts anyways I still do a little mobility, stretching and walking on off days. I have made a lot of progress and the effort throughout the week is much less. It's crazy! With that being said it's still good to switch it up. I'll do an upper/lower or push/pull/legs split time to time."

Others do really well on high volume!\n \nIn general, I tend to recommend more volume for those that want to improve size, as the research shows that gains tend to scale quite linearly with volume. However, it might not be that clear, for a few reasons.\n \nHigh volume training\n tends to increase \nsarcoplasm \nin the muscle. This is like your fuel tank-it includes glycogen storage as well as mitochondria for energy production needed during high volume training.\nSo, if you train with high volumes, your body can adapt by making your fuel tank bigger. Makes sense, right? This looks like muscle\u2026because it basically \nIS \nmuscle. It\u2019s \nin \nthe muscle and it looks like muscle from the outside. It\u2019s muscle\u2026just a different type.\n \nBut\u2026it won\u2019t really make you \nstronger\n. In fact, pound for pound, it\u2019ll actually make you \nWEAKER\n, as it doesn\u2019t help your strength, but does add weight!\n \nIt\u2019s not contractile tissue!\nMuscle is mostly water\u2026and then protein\u2026but there is glycogen and fat there, too. That\u2019s sarcoplasm. Fuel tank.\n \nSo, a lot of these studies are switching people from low (or no) volume programs to high volume programs, and finding that their muscles get bigger. A big part of what they are often seeing is the fuel tank getting bigger in response\u2026\nnot \nthe actual muscle fibers!\n \nI\u2019d wager that after a few weeks of going back to lower volume training (or nothing)\u2026a lot of those gains are going to be lost, because they body doesn\u2019t really need as big of a fuel tank anymore. It\u2019s temporary. It\u2019s transient. If I do high volume and then go on vacation, in a week or two, that extra weight is GONE. It\u2019s often up to 4\u20135kg, and it\u2019s not preventable with eating more. It\u2019s a response to training.\n \nIt\u2019s a longer-duration pump.\nArnold\n \nloved \nthe pump\u2026he often trained forty, fifty, sixty sets per workout before competitions. And he responded marvelously to it.\n \nHe bench pressed north of 500lbs when he was a young man, but during his Mr. Olympia prep, most sets seemed to be with 2\u20133 plates per side-just 225\u2013315lbs, about 50\u201360% of 1 rep max!\n \nFor set, after set, after set.\nSerge Nubret\n did as well-he did mostly sets of 15\u201320 reps far away from failure his entire career. Sometimes his workouts lasted \nFIVE HOURS\n, and he did them 6 times per week.\n \nPlus, he was French, so it was literally a full time job!\n \nWill this work for you?\n \nMaybe. But probably not.\n \nWithout anabolics, this type of training isn\u2019t nearly as effective for size.\n \nMost strong advocates for \nhigh volume training \nare on drugs.\n \nDoing endless sets will just leave you tired, battered and injured.\n \nHowever\u2026the thing is, most strong advocates for \nlow volume training\n are also on drugs.\n \nThe Dorian and Menzer method of one all out set to failure works for naturals\u2026but best with pharmaceutical enhancement.\nThey are ALWAYS growing, so they can get away with this type of training.\n \nFor naturals, both high volume and low volume are death sentences for gains.\n \nWhy?\n \nHigh volume\n will cause an increase in cortisol, which is very catabolic and can cause muscle breakdown. It can also cause a decrease in testosterone, and if you are natural you don\u2019t have the luxury of ignoring that. High volume will pump you up, but after a few weeks you\u2019ll plateau hard. Your sarcoplasm can only get so big.\n \nLow volume\n isn\u2019t enough stimulation for a natural to grow optimally in \nmost \ncases. Especially if you cannot push a set close to or to TRUE failure, then low volume training will be crap for gains. Guess what? Most people cannot-or at least, do not.\n \nI think in five years, I\u2019ve seen maybe five people go to true failure in the gym\u2026let alone go beyond failure. Part of that is because I\u2019m in China where the gym culture is new\u2026but I think globally, people training HARD is just quite rare. I typically train quite \nclose\n \nto\n \nfailure\n.\nIt\u2019s just how I\u2019m wired.\n \nFor a natural, ideally you need a mix. Moderate volume most of the time, occasional high volume blocks, occasional low volume blocks with the odd week or two totally off.\n \nSometimes to failure, sometimes a few reps shy, sometimes completely avoiding it, especially if your goal is strength as well as size.\n \nYou need to be SMART about how much volume you do. A lot of this is individual, and you\u2019ll have to discover for yourself.\n \nFollow me on \nInstagram \nfor daily diet and training tips!

Some muscle groups may become so used to this stress they don\u2019t really get sore anymore and will require different exercises and increased weight/intensity to get sore.\n \nDon\u2019t work a muscle that is already sore if you have only given it a day or two of rest. Be sure to stretch their full range of motion and do some very light exercise with them to flush them out. You\u2019d be amazed how much better your legs will feel after leg day if you go for a light jog the following day."

It will keep recovering until you start your workout.\n \nDoes muscles only grow on rest days?\n \nSo a simple explanation\n \nAnabolic - Creating new tissue, cells or organs.\n \nCatabolic\n - \nBreak down of cells in your body.\n \nOur body can never be in both states at once.\n \nWorking out = Catabolic\n \nWe perform resistance training to cause damage to the muscle fibers.\n \nThis means we enter a catabolic state as we put stress on our body, our body releases these main hormones\nTestosterone\nInsulin Like growth factor(IGF)\nGrowth Hormone(GH)\nCortisol\nWhen we are in a catabolic state, our body is breaking down fat and glycogen to be used as energy.\n \nRecovery = Anabolic\n \nNow that we have caused damaged to the muscle fibers, we begin the process of repairing the muscle fibers. Once the muscle fibers are repaired they increase in size\n \nThis is muscle hypertrophy.\n \nHow does it work?\n \nMuscle growth occurs whenever the rate of muscle protein synthesis(MPS) is greater than the rate of muscle protein breakdown. Both, the synthesis and breakdown of proteins are controlled by complimentary cellular mechanisms. Resistance exercise can profoundly stimulate muscle cell hypertrophy and the resultant gain in strength. However, the time course for this hypertrophy is relatively slow, generally taking several weeks or months to be apparent\n[1]\n \nIt is generally agreed that resistance exercise results in increased MPS in the postexercise recovery period . Indeed, an acute bout of resistance exercise can increase the rate of MPS about two- to fivefold after exercise, and this effect can persist for up to 48 h in fed subjects \n[2]\n \nSo given we can only be in one state at a time, muscle building will only start once you are done working out and you are in your recovery phase.\n \nMuscle building does not mean just taking a day off from the gym.\n \nYou also need to pay special attention to these for hypertrophy\nCaloric surplus diet with sufficient protein\nAdequate sleep\nManage stress levels\nFootnotes\n[1] \nHow Do Muscles Grow?\n[2] \nJournal of Applied Physiology"

Those are all good options, but let me suggest another one that will ensure you leave your workout in full body fashion\u2014enter: full body workout finishers.\n \n\u2014\n \nWhat the heck is a workout finisher?\nA workout finisher is a \nmini workout\n that you slide right at the end of your main workout. Finishers are great because they provide with you a highly effective full body workout in just a few minutes.\n \nBasically, finishers are designed to hurt.\n \nI mean not physically hurt you like getting spartan kicked in the chest would, but they should sting a little (or, a lot). Words and phrases that jump to mind when we\u2019re talking finishers include:\nlactic acid buildup\nburning and searing\nthe darkest of pain caves\nbattery acid pumping through your veins\nI\u2019m sure there are more but you get the idea.\n \nSo, how long should these epic pain-fests last?\n \nWell, there is no perfect answer here, but because the intensity of effort should be quite high I suggest keeping a finisher to around 8 (ish) minutes or less.\n \n\u2014\n \nWhy finishers are awesome\u2026\n \nBelow is the abridged list of why finisher are awesome:\naccelerate fat loss\nextremely time efficient\nincrease work capacity/conditioning\nincrease mental toughness and ability to endure \u201cthe suck\u201d\n\u2014\n \nWhat types of exercises make the best workout finishers?\nAgain, there is no perfect answer here, but my rule of thumb is to\n go lower on the skill side, and higher on the intensity side.\n \nThe reason I say this is that performing a bunch of highly technical/highly skilled movements as a finisher may actually decrease the intensity of effort.\n \nLet me explain.\n \nHighly technical and highly skilled movements require a great deal of finesse. If you\u2019re super tired halfway through a finisher and you literally can\u2019t do another rep of that high skilled movement (such as a muscle up), well my friend, you\u2019re basically left just staring at the piece of equipment, letting your heart rate drop, and honestly not doing a finisher anymore.\n \nThis is the opposite of what you want.\n \nRemember, the goal with a finisher is to finish the workout with intensity. This means you\u2019ll have to put a bit of thought into the exercises you select here. Personally, I\u2019ve found the best exercises for finishers are the ones that allow you to keep grinding out reps, no matter how tired you get.\n \nExamples of these type of grind style exercises include:\nCardio machines\nBattle rope exercises\nVarious types of crawling\nAny sort of loaded carry\nKettlebell or dumbbell swings\nBasic bodyweight movements (pushups, squats, burpees,\u2026etc)\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but it definitely gives us a good place to start.\n \nWhen selecting exercises for a finisher the \nbig take-a-way is to shift more to grind style exercises vs. highly technical/high skilled exercises.\n Again, the point of doing this is to keep you moving, vs. just staring at the bottom of set of rings because you can\u2019t nail your 5th muscle up in the finisher.\n \n\u2014\n \nPutting it all together: 5 badass full body finishers\nFinisher #1\u2192\n \nComplete as many rounds as possible in 6 minutes of:\n10 kettlebell swings\n50 foot goblet carry\n50 foot bear crawl\nFinisher #2\u2192\n \nThree rounds of:\n12 dumbbell front squat\n12 dumbbell walking lunge steps (6 per leg)\n10 jump squats\n10 jump lunges (5 per leg)\nFinisher #3\u2192\n \n30 hand release pushups\n16 burpees\n16 sandbag getups\n20 \nhand release pushups\n8 burpees\n8 sandbag getups\n10 hand release pushup\n4 burpees\n4 sandbag getups\nFinisher #4\u2192\n \nThree rounds of:\n30 second dumbbell farmers carry (heavy)\n30 second bear crawl\n30 second air squats\n30 second dumbbell rack hold\n30 second hollow body hold\nFinisher #5\u2192\n \n60 second stair climber (fast)\n20 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n45 second stair climber (fast)\n15 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n30 second stair climber (fast)\n10 kettlebell swings\n2 burpees\n \nThese five finishers all pack a potent punch, but for different reasons. However, two commonalities they share is their time effectiveness, and high suck factor rating.\n \n\u2014\n \nFinal thoughts\n \nAs it seems, the answers you seek have already been laid out before you. I just wanted to throw finishers into the mix so you have a plan for \u201cending the workout with some intensity.\u201d The five finishers I listed above will ensure that you finish any workout in full body fashion.\n \nGive them a try. Who knows, you might even love to hate full body workout finishers.\n \nHope this post is helpful.\n \nThanks for reading.\n-Tom C"

Understand that the body gets adapted to a certain weight after some time and then we have to pick more, to feel that same punch there. The flow will carry on. Thus, you will definitely pick more weight after some time and maybe much more than you are presently imagining.\n \nYou must also understand your target. What do you want to do?

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes."

Although they do build a nice chest/shoulders, you're never really going to need to do a strict press in every day movements. Not only will the bent row improve your posture, but will also heavily tax your lats, low back, and abs. \nI've chosen these three because they're, in my opinion, the more important of the primal movement patterns to be done correctly. You will \nnot\n be able to build a well rounded, show ready physique, but you can become much, much stronger in every day life and while doing the majority of every day tasks."

Just make sure that push-ups are a part of your training everyday.\n \nSquats\n \nThe squat is another classic lifting exercise that is especially beneficial to the lower body. The exercise directly works the hips and hamstrings. It also indirectly strengthens your core and even your upper body if done with weight. Amateur weightlifters often times focus on their upper body and neglect the lower half. Don't fall for that. Any training regimen should work the entire body and squats are an essential piece. They're that good for you.\n \nDeadlift\n \nThe deadlift builds total-body strength. It's a gimmie for the best-exercise title, but it does come with risks. The wrong technique can injure your back, so it's important to keep it flat throughout the lift. When the deadlift is executed correctly it will strengthen your back as well as your calves, quads, hamstrings, core and forearms.\n \nThe lift is simple and with the proper focus and attention to technique it can be completed without injury. The goal is to pick up a weighted bar off the ground and bring it up to your thighs using your whole body. The completion of the lift will have you standing up, your arms straight with the weight hanging.\n \nThe deadlift is effective at building strength because the inert weight starts on the ground and must be lifted up in a controlled movement. The lifter doesn't have a chance to use any momentum, hence the \"dead\" name.\n \nSource: \nThe 7 Best Exercises for a Full-Body Workout\n \nThe 5 Best Exercises For A Full-Body Workout"

It works those muscles explosively and in a natural, athletic fashion. It builds explosive strength from the floor, squat strength and quick hip flexion.\n \nTWO\n \nPush press has been showed to produce more rate of force development in the legs than squats or even cleans do. A shorts rom, but enough to give you power to jumpe, sprint etc (which is a short rom too if you break it down). With heavy weights over your head, everything under (back, core, glutes and ofc shoulders girdle) it has to stabilise it, like pillars holding a roof. It devolops massive triceps and delts, even traps and CHEST. Yes. The entire upper body except biceps and. Unlike chest presses, overhead presses develops the delt much much better, and works the meatiest part of the tricep more. You will have a more round chest (less down-heavy like benchers) and wider, rounder delts. Also produces less injury than benching due to more balansed development (and you can actually drop it on the floor, unlike a bench press..). The weight will be heavy AF on the way down since you used legs to get it up. Humans are stronger on exentric reps, and this exercise is actually HEAVIER for that part, which is unique. It may allow you to hold weights close to your max bench OVERHEAD and standing up. Possibly the #1 exercise of all time.\n \nTHREE\n \nWeighted chins will develop the muscles that have already been hit, but not hammered. 2/3 of your torso muscles (or more) will be crushed. Biceps, forearms, lats, rhomboids, rear delts (which compensates for the push press), lower and middle traps, abs and even a bit of upper chest (according to studies). Can be done very heavy.\n \nIf you get to a 1.5x weight on all these exercises (on chins that means adding 50% of your own bw) for a few reps, you will not have any imbalance. Unlike squat bench and dead, these exercise includes explosive training. They will also give you better delts and traps and a more \u201cmasculine\u201dchest. You will be more athletic with those, and more balanced. Squat bench dead has no upper body pulling to work biceps and rear delts, and the bench almost exclusively works the front part. Bad. Another benefit is that squats and deads have higher injury risk, but explosive movements with a moderate weight might build the same size without overloading soft tissue.\n \nPlease let me know what you think"

Psychologist's call these people, 'Over-Motivated Underachievers' because they work hard (a prized cultural skill) but don't necessarily get anywhere because the body just can't handle high amounts of stress for long periods of time.\n \nThis is why phases are essential, your body needs rest to adapt.\n \nGenerally speaking most people can't tolerate high volume and high intensity at the same time (intensity is how high the percentage of 1RM any lifts are...1RM or above is the highest intensity), so you must balance the two. \n \nThis could be as simple as alternating between intensification phase and an accumulation phase (i.e. one phase is intense, low volume, high load - the other is volume oriented, lower intensity, higher volume, medium to low load).\n \nIt can be as complex as undulating sequences too, there are many components to neuromuscular training.\n \nDown weeks are also crucial here if you have high intensity or high volume training phases, allowing for supercompensation to take place is essential.\n \nWork + Rest = Success\n \n4 - Rest Changes\n \nThe less rest you give yourself between sets, between exercises, between training days and between training cycles, the harder it is on your system.\n \nThe more intense a workout, the more rest you need between sets and possibly workouts/phases.\n \nThe more volume in a workout, the more rest you need between workouts.\n \nManipulate rest to longer when you need it, and shorter when you want to challenge your nervous system in a new way.\n \nAgain - in phases.\n \n5 - Multi-Planar Adaptation\n \nThe problem with simplifying leg training to two major lifts is that these lifts often only address one plane of movement, forward and back (Sagital Plane it's called). \n \nYour muscles are 3-D, meaning you had better include some exercises eventually somewhere that require you to move laterally (i.e. Side Lunges, Lateral Sled Pushing, Shuffling, etc...) and rotationally (the transverse plane includes movements like chops, lifts, throwing, etc...).\n \nScientifically speaking, the body is capable of generating more power when engaged through all three planes (think of the amount of watts generated throwing a baseball or a shotput, it's significantly more than even a world-class squat or deadlift). \n \nDon't forget also to train unilaterally (one leg, like single leg squats, step-ups, lunges, etc...) as this forces the body into multiple planes of resistance.\n \nYou're leaving a lot of muscle untouched by training just two movements, or by using the majority of machines, and you're not refining your nervous system optimally.\n \ni.e. Single Leg, Single Arm Deadlifts challenge the body in all three planes. So would rotational rows, and standing position chops and lifts, among many others.\n \nSo would the majority of throwing activities, hitting activities, kicking (though more of the angular type found in soccer), etc... \n \nI'm not saying you should load patterns similar to your sport (you shouldn't, it's actually been shown to alter movement patterns to a point of decreased performance) but you should get out of the Saggital plane with your training from time to time and challenge your muscles as they are intended to be used, in 3-D).\n \nThere are a lot of good lifts at the gym that people either don't use correctly, or simply don't know.\n \n6 - Mechanical Loading Changes\n \nAre you lifting in your barefeet or in shoes, because the difference can matter to how your body responds. Barefoot will tax your feet/toes more than in shoes.\n \nThere are other considerations though, the overhead squat is significantly harder than a front or back squat because the mechanical advantage in the lift is reduced by the placement of the load above the head.\n \nPutting a dumbbell on one side only, taxes your body and your nervous system differently.\n \nPutting a dumbbell on the shoulders instead of the hands.\n \nA barbell instead of a dumbbell.\n \nChanging the angle of pull (wide stance, vs narrow stance) will change the outcome.\n \n7 - Threshold Considerations\n \nTraining the squat and deadlift all the time will train a lot of muscle, but it won't train the nervous system to respond to low threshold situations.\n \nYour nervous system is tuned to relax and contract at varying levels of intensity, so if low levels of intensity are out of whack (things like breathing, spinal segmental stabilization, etc...) your ability to fully engage at high nervous system thresholds is diminished.\n \nSo nervous system training kind of resembles a sliding scale from low to high threshold activities.\n \nIt seems a little on the 'girly' side (\nfor most men - while most women avoid the high threshold stuff\n) sometimes, but it's the smart way to train.\n \nEnsure that your body can tolerate body weight squats just as well as loaded squats. Basic glute bridges, just as well as heavy deadlifts.\n \nThese low threshold exercises are great for warm-ups.\n \ni.e. clamshells, quadruped lifts, plank variations, deadbugs, etc...\n \n8 - Range of Motion Considerations\n \nA quarter squat isn't the same as a full squat. The glutes and hamstrings are far more engaged in the latter.\n \nMobility training is important, and I generally encourage people to move through 'as full a range of motion as possible' when I'm coaching people. \n \nWork to improve your range of motion appropriately through all the major lifts, it will help a lot in your development at the gym.\n \nHowever, shortening up the range of motion can occasionally lead to break-throughs, and has it's place.\n \ni.e. you get stuck at the same spot on your bench press all the time, we can increase your strength at that point but employing a board press where you get stuck.\n \n9 - Addressing Weaknesses\n \nYou could squat and deadlift and hit a lot of muscle, but you'll plateau eventually.\n \nAt that point you'll want to start using accessory movements to push through them.\n \nIf hamstrings are the weak link then maybe we want to address them a little more intensely with romanian deadlifts or single leg romanian deadlifts, or glute ham raises?\n \nIf the glutes are the weak link, maybe we want to do some pull-throughs, or some loaded hip thrusts.\n \nIf the calves are a weak link, maybe we want to do some calf raises seated or standing, or some explosive jump training (which always lights my calves up...).\n \nUltimately, I'm missing some considerations for sure but the leg does the following movements worth training at some point:\n \nCircumduct the Ankle (rotation at the ankle)\nSupination and Pronation of the Ankle (Roll the foot inward and outward)\nPlantar Flex the Ankle (push foot down)\nDorsi Flex the Ankle (pull foot up)\nExtension/Flexion of Foot + Toes\nFeet Assist in Stabilizing the Ankle and Knee\nFlex and Extend the Knee\nStabilize the Knee\nExternally and Internally Rotate the Hip\nFlex and Extend the Hip\nADDuct and ABduct the Hip\nStabilize the Hip\nCombinations of all the above (the most likely and obvious training choices are ones that put your body through more than one of the movements above...)\nGood luck and enjoy yourself!"

This isn't your typical shrug; using a snatch grip (a wide grip) on the barbell really targets the upper traps more intensely than a regular grip.\n \nTo perform it, I stand with my feet shoulder-width apart, grip the barbell with my hands spaced wider than shoulder-width, and then shrug my shoulders up towards my ears. The wider grip increases the range of motion and really isolates the traps. I do three sets of 10-12 reps, focusing on a slow, controlled movement and a strong contraction at the top.\nAnother exercise that has yielded fantastic results for my traps is the \nFace Pull with External Rotation\n. This exercise not only works the traps but also hits the rear delts and improves shoulder health.\n \nUsing a cable machine with a rope attachment, I set the pulley at about face height. I pull the rope towards my face, focusing on keeping my elbows high and squeezing my shoulder blades together. At the end of the pull, I rotate my wrists outward to emphasize the contraction in my traps and rear delts. I aim for three sets of 15 reps, keeping the movement slow and controlled to maximize muscle engagement.\n \nLastly, the \nDumbbell Farmer's Walk\n is an underrated but incredibly effective exercise for building trap strength and endurance. I grab the heaviest dumbbells I can handle and walk back and forth across the gym. The constant tension from holding the heavy weights forces my traps to engage and support my shoulders.\n \nI usually do this for 3-4 sets, walking for about 30-60 seconds each set. Not only does this build my traps, but it also improves my grip strength and overall core stability.\n \nThey might not be the most common choices, but their effectiveness is undeniable. If you're looking to build impressive traps, give these a try \u2013 you won't be disappointed."

As requested, here are my before & after pictures:\n \nBefore Transformation (100 kgs at 5\u20328\u2033)\nAfter Transformation\n \n(72 kgs at 5\u20328\u2033)\nIt took me two and half years to achieve this transformation. I couldn't afford a personal trainer and I also wanted to know everything about fitness so that I can keep myself fit for lifelong without becoming too much dependent on others. So, I read and learned everything I could about various kinds of exercises & diets. I experimented with various split & full body routines. I tried various kinds of diets such as ketogenic & carb-cycling. I achived different level of results with all.\n \nSo, based on my experience, I can tell you that there are many ways to achieve the transformation you want but you can't and shouldn't limit yourself to just three exercises. That's why I am including more than three exercises, but only those that are the best. If you can create a program around these\n \nten exercises, you will be making good progress :\nBarbell Back Squat : \nIt's\n \nthe best exercise for your lower body. If done in correct form, and if you go below parallel, it will work not only your quads but also hamstrings, glutes and core.\nDeadlift\n \n: \nAlong with squats, deadlift is one of the best exercise to build overall mass and strength. It targets your posterior chain including hamstring, glutes, erector spine & lats. Your core gets a good workout and it also improves your grip strength & forearm size.\nStanding Calves Raise\n \n: \nI do it on smith machine standing on step board. It's best for calves.\nFlat & Inclined\n \nBench Press : \nBest exercise for chest but also works your anterior deltoids(front shoulders) and triceps. You can also do pushups for same effect but you won't be able to use as much weight as in bench press.\nMilitary Press : \nBest exercise to target shoulder.\nBent Over Barbell Rows : \nGood exercise for lats, middle back, biceps & core.\nPull Ups & Chin Ups\n :\n \nBest exercise for lats & biceps.\nParallel Bar Dips\n : Best for triceps.\nHIIT : \nFor cardiovascular health & fat loss. Sprint for 30 seconds and then walk for 30 seconds. Repeat for total 15 to 20 mins.\nYoga Poses : \nFor flexibility & proper alignment of body.\nP.S. : I know Yoga is not a single exercise but I included it to put emphasis on importance of flexibility & mobility work. Other kinds of flexibility & mobility routines will work too."

It is one of only a handful of exercises that target muscles in the upper and lower body. There are countless reasons to include them in your workout regime to get a good strong body that you aspire for.\n \n3. SQUAT\nSquats help build muscle. They don't just help you achieve wonderful, toned legs; they promote body-wide muscle building by creating an anabolic (muscle building) environment in the body. They work up your quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, abdominal muscles, lower back and your glutes too. Everyone should include them in your workout routine to get strong legs and thigh muscles.\n \nP.S. Performing Squats and Deadlifts is imperative to reduce the risk of injury. Thus, hiring a personal trainer to learn the correct form is of prime importance.\n \nStay Fit, Be Active, Remain Healthy!"

Here are some general guidelines for an effective workout routine:\nAim for 3-5 days of exercise per week, with a mix of cardiovascular activity, strength training, and flexibility work.\nFor cardiovascular exercise, options include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, or using an elliptical machine. Aim for 150-300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity cardio.\nStrength training 2-3 times per week, focusing on major muscle groups like the legs, back, chest, shoulders, and arms.

Aim for 150-300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity cardio.\nStrength training 2-3 times per week, focusing on major muscle groups like the legs, back, chest, shoulders, and arms. You can use free weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises.\nInclude 10-15 minutes of dynamic stretching and mobility work before workouts, and static stretching afterwards.\nProgressive overload is key - gradually increase the intensity, duration, or weight over time to continually challenge your body.\nAllow for rest and recovery days between sessions for the same muscle groups.\nConsider your individual needs, such as any injuries or limitations, and adjust the routine accordingly.\nThe most important thing is finding a sustainable routine you enjoy that helps you work towards your fitness goals. Experiment to discover what works best for your body and lifestyle."

If you put my name into Quora I suspect you will see the many questions I have answered regarding work-out routines. If you\u2019re just starting out, I\u2019d book an hour with a Personal Trainer. It will be well worth the time and money. Talk about what you'd like to accomplish, what your goals are and ask if you could talk just a bit about nutrition and diet because that contributes greatly to getting to or staying at goal weight. Places I've worked out at include Tracy Anderson\u2019s Studio in LA, Barry\u2019s Bootcamp in LA, Pure Barre in Los Gatos, here in Northern California where I live. I\u2019ve studied ballet so I do some of those basic exercises. I love to dance so I\u2019ve done Zumba. I subscribe for free to XPT life with Gabby Reece and Laird Hamilton. They give weekly inspiration to get and keep you fit. She\u2019s an Olympian and he\u2019s a big wave surfer, so they are at the top of their game always, but I like to learn from the best! I hope I\u2019ve covered some of what you are asking. I still like the basics - do something cardio first, then sit-ups, planks front and side, lunges, burpees, squats, push-ups. I try to conquer the pull-up which remains hard for me. I ended up putting up a bar in my cellar, and sometimes I just hang from it, then I try hoisting myself up and down for as many times as I can which is usually only a few. I gotta keep working on that. Best of luck and thanks for stopping by\u2026"

It's widely considered as one of the best approaches for beginners looking to up their general body strength before taking up some more specific approaches. Each workout day is typically followed by a rest day to allow for muscle recovery.\n \nSplit Routines\n \nThis approach emphasizes a particular body region or a group of muscles per workout day. Good examples include the Upper/Lower Body and Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) Split Routines. The former typically alternates between upper and lower body Workouts in the first 2 days followed by a rest/recovery day. The latter alternates Push and pull workouts in the first 2 days followed by a leg day.\n \nCheck out this comprehensive read for more details on workout routines and how you can go about choosing what should work best for you:\nhttps://healthnuggetdotcom.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/workout-routines/"

Though this will build muscle, it won't lead to optimal muscle growth rates.\n \nInstead of bombing a muscle group each day with endless volume, you are better off targeting muscle groups several times per week with a smaller amount of volume per day. By training a muscle group 2-3x per week with a more moderate volume, you will experience a greater degree of weekly protein synthesis per muscle group, and as a result, more optimal gains.\n \nIf you want to build muscle as rapidly as possible, consider switching to a full body workout. By targeting each muscle group 3 times per week, you will keep protein synthesis levels higher, on the average, which will lead to more optimal gains.\n \nFor intermediate lifters who have already built a quality amount of strength, training on an upper/lower or push/pull/legs split might be a better option. Heavy weight can take it's toll on joints and connective tissue, so a few extra days of rest per week might be beneficial\n \nGreets,\n \nJoel"

Because frankly, writing some long ass answer hailing myself and my good habits is just too awkward for my taste.\n \nI\u2019ve always been bad at flossing.\nDENTAL flossing.\nThat\u2019s more like it.\n \nI\u2019ve tried creating a steady flossing habit for what feels like my whole life.\n \nI often manage to get started too, but somehow, my routine always falls off a cliff. I\u2019m going at it, gaining steam for a couple weeks, and then\u201d\npoof,\u201d \nmy momentum stops, dead in its tracks.\n \nJust like with you and training, I know flossing is good for me. I\u2019ve seen horrific pictures of rotten, brown teeth and they scare the living shit out of me. I\u2019m definitely motivated to floss.\n \nWhat makes my failures even stupider is that flossing takes little to no time and doesn\u2019t require anything but the smallest amount of effort. I don\u2019t even have to leave the house\u2014I\u2019ve had the same damn flossers in my bathroom cabinet since the Mongols laid waste to all of Eurasia.\n \nI have no excuses.\n \nBut I can\u2019t do it.\n \nSo what gives?\n \nOne part of creating good habits is getting the ball rolling.\n \nBecause healthy routines are like a ball of snow rolling down a hill, steady gaining size and speed. It\u2019s hard to get it moving in the beginning and the longer we do something, the easier it is to keep doing it. But this, while true, is also not helpful. \u201cJust do it\u201d is bad advice, because \nwe\u2019re already trying to.\n \nThis view, of self-discipline=routines, creates a chicken-egg situation: to build healthy routines, we need self-discipline over a long period of time; but self-discipline is in itself a healthy routine, so how the flying fuck do we create that in the first place?\n \nAnother\u2014often underrated\u2014aspect of habit-creation is making the habit as \neasy to implement as possible.\n \nIt\u2019s not about powering through using the self-discipline we wish we had, but creating \nan environment\n where a habit is likely to prosper.\n \nI\u2019ve been flossing every day for 4 months now.\n \nI guess I deserve a medal or at least a diploma of some sort.\n \nWhat\u2019s crazy is how the way I finally made it stick is so stupid and simple I can\u2019t even fathom it.\n \nI put the flosser \nwith\n \nmy toothbrush.\n \nI was already brushing my teeth. I mastered that shit in kindergarten. Now, every time I do that deeply ingrained habit, I get an instant reminder to up my flossing game while I\u2019m at it.\n \nI also bought approximately a lifetime\u2019s worth of dental floss so I always have some available.\n \nBecause I know, If I have to go the store to buy some, it\u2019s not happening.\nWhen we start doing something new and challenging, our identity and previous habits become this force of nature, pulling us back, to our previous selves.\n \nOur status quo.\n \nTo oppose those forces, we need to create our own force field, one which pulls us toward the habits we wish to create.\n \nI see too many people spend their whole existence in an epic fight to go to a dimly lit place and lift weights/and or run on a treadmill.\n \nWorking out shouldn\u2019t be an epic battle.\n \nStupid as it is, we often stop doing what we achieve to do, not because we don\u2019t want to do the core thing, but because of all the small annoyances we associate it with.\n \nIf you\u2014like me\u2014ever skipped a work-out because you lacked the proper socks, had a bad hair-day or because it was raining and fuck if you\u2019re going out in the rain, you know this all too well.\n \nWe should aim to minimise the friction and pain associated with creating a habit and maximise the friction and pain associated with not creating it.\n \nWe should strive to make training as tempting as possible, while avoiding it should be hard and painful.\n \nI floss, not because of my super-saiyan willpower, but because I\u2019ve minimised the friction flossing creates in my life and head, while making the implementation of the habit as smooth and pain-free as possible.\n \nHere are some specific examples as to how you can create an environment where the habit of exercise is likely to prosper:\nPrepare the things you need beforehand.\n Have your gym bag with clean clothes, water bottle, towel, etc ready. Fill it with everything you need and put it by your door. It will serve as a constant reminder, telling you how close you are to go to the gym.\nSet a fixed time.\n Ever postponed anything? Yeah, me too. So why not schedule your training? By giving giving training a specific time and place, much like a deadline, we can making procrastination an as small a factor as possible. Put that shit in your calendar if you have too\u2014it\u2019s what I do for my studies.\nKnow where you\u2019re going to train and become familiar with the place and logistics.\n Where is the water fountain? \nIs there \na water fountain? What equipment do they have? When is the best time to go? These logistics, while seemingly minuscule, can add up to a lot of friction and make it harder than it has to be to make this habit stick.\nHave a training plan. \nThere is a syndrome in the fitness industry popularly termed \u201cfuckarounditis.\u201d Fuckarounditis, while bad for progress, is also inherently unhelpful for making training a habit. Don\u2019t just plan to go to the gym today. Plan to go, do X exercises for X reps/time with X goal in mind. If you\u2019re going to the gym, with no plan and no particular goal you wish to accomplish, procrastinating on it becomes very tempting.\nSet some specific short-term goals and measure your progress. \nHave something you wish to accomplish every day you\u2019re there. Maybe it\u2019s lifting 1 rep more than last time, running a bit longer, or something as simple as improving at a certain movement. Mastery waters and stimulates motivation while incompetence kills it. Take advantage of that\nGet to know those who work there.\n You don\u2019t have to be friends or anything, but make a bit of small talk. Say hi. Smile. Get to know the lines of their faces. A familiar smile is a lot more appealing than a strangers glance.\nMake your workout part of a routine.\n A popular tip I give is to train on the way home from work or on the way to it. The road from your coach to the front door can feel longer and more daunting than a marathon on pouring rain. Going by the gym when you\u2019re already out and about is on the other hand often as close to effortless as it gets.\nGo with a friend. \nSocial pressure is real. Cancelling an appointment is a lot harder than postponing a workout in your head. As a bonus, camaraderie can also make training more enjoyable. Yes, it should be enjoyable too.\nIf all else fails, hire a personal trainer and set up sessions several months in advance. \nIn the business, we use this as a tactic because it minimises flakiness. While people may want to avoid working out, they also don\u2019t like calling someone to cancel an appointment they\u2019re paying for and know they should go to. You can use this too your advantage too.\nHave some fun.\n The best way to keep going to the gym is to actually enjoy yourself while you\u2019re there. Experiment a bit. Find out what part of training is the most fun or at least sucks less. Too many treat the gym as a place of suffering. Counterintuitively, this makes it harder to go than it has to be. When you find something enjoyable about it, you may even find yourself wanting to go. In the end, that\u2019s what makes habits stick. People who wake up at 5am in the morning don\u2019t do so because they\u2019re running on extreme amounts of willpower, but because they, crazy as it is, actually enjoy it."

If you want to get stronger, the only way is to increase your muscle size and density.  Period.  Granted, you could lose fat and build muscle and still weigh the same, but I assure you, when this happens, you WILL look more muscular, and that\u2019s not a bad thing.\n \nIt appears that you\u2019re looking to increase your functional strength as opposed to your gym strength.  To build functional strength, compound movements are the best way to go.  Compound movements are Olympic type lifts that require you to transition from one large muscle group to another large muscle group.  For instance, in the power-clean, you go from a deadlift start and end up standing with the weight pressed above your head.  Obviously you will not be able to clean as much weight as you would if you were doing a normal deadlift since you will have to press the weight over your head.\n \nThe difficulty I have in suggesting a customized training plan for anyone that I don\u2019t get to work with in the gym is that everyone is different in their strengths and weaknesses and while one lifter may have more endurance, another may have more explosive power.  These two lifters will respond differently to a set workout and it\u2019s up to a good coach to recognize when to push one aspect (explosive power) or the other (higher reps).\n \nGenerally, to build muscle strength and density, you should use a pyramid scheme that focuses on at least five sets, excluding your first and maybe your second set which is merely a warmup.  After your warmup with extremely light weights, your next three lifts will incrementally build up to your last two sets, which is where the work and growth really begins.  Your last two sets should be at a weight where you are on the verge of struggling, while keeping good form.  On the bench, your last two sets should require your spotter to keep a careful eye on your lifting, ready to assist if necessary.\n \nIf you\u2019re lifting heavy weights, then the number of sets you should do will increase because you\u2019re need more sets to safely work up to your max weight, and your muscles will need more work to get to the top weight.  For instance, approximately 8 weeks through a 13 week lifting cycle is when I want to start hitting certain milestones to ensure I will be at the top of my game come competition time.  Here\u2019s a typical example of my bench workout.\nWarmup with just the bar;\nWarmup with just the bar;\n10 reps at 135;\n6 reps at 185;\n6 reps at 225;\n6 reps at 275;\n6 reps at 315;\n6 reps at 345 - This is my working set\n6 reps at 375 - This is the second of my working set.\nAlthough this \u201croutine\u201d seems pretty standard, the importance of having a good coach cannot be understated.  What my coach would do is watch how easy I did a set, then calculate what the next weight would be.  For instance, if on #7 I slowed down on rep 5 & 6, meaning my explosive power was waning, he would either make me rest a bit more to allow me to recover more, but not too much, or on set #8, he may move the weight only to 330.  The object is to be able to hit your working weight and complete it almost to exhaustion.  If I was having a particularly bad day, I may take out a set and adjust the weight accordingly.  What was most important is hitting your working sets and completing them.  This is important for several reasons, but the primary reason you want to complete your working sets is psychological.  When it comes down to it, it doesn\u2019t matter what weight you lifted on set#6, or even if you have a set #6, what matters is you hit your goal for that week.  You\u2019re setting yourself up for success the following week by being successful this week.\n \nIt is so important to hit your goals that even on weeks where I found myself stronger than expected, i.e. I blew through my first working set without any issue and it feels like I can add another 50# for my second working set with no problem, instead of increasing my goal for that week, I was told to focus on more explosion or better form and technique instead of adding additional pounds to that week\u2019s goal.  What the coach may then do is recalculate \nnext\n week\u2019s goal a bit higher.\n \nI guess the take away from this long winded answer is to set a lifting cycle for at least three months.  Start the first week by doing approximately six sets for eights, the second week, drop off a rep and do six sets for seven, increasing each successive set\u2019s weight more than the week before.  You should be able to handle this as you\u2019re taking away a rep.  Next week, drop a rep and increase the weight\u2026.\n \nIt\u2019s important to set a goal and take the necessary incremental steps to reach that goal.  Some people go to they gym with the attitude of \u201cI want to get stronger\u201d, which is good, but difficult to achieve because it is so ambiguous.  However, if you say \u201cToday I can do a max one rep bench at 225 and in 12 weeks I want to be able to max at 275\u201d that is a goal that can be tracked accurately and you can adjust your weights, sets, reps, diet, sleeping accordingly.  At the end of the 12 weeks, hit your goal then take a week away from the gym, maybe a bit more, then come back and say \u201cToday I can do a max one rep bench at 275 and in 12 weeks I want to be able to max at 315.\u201d  Then, you chalk up your hands and get to work."

If you can't go 30 minutes, slow down until you can.\n \nSupplement this with strength and mobility exercises, either after the cardio or a different day. If you have access to weights, then stick with the major lifts: bench press, squat, deadlift, overhead press, lat pull down. If you don't, then use bodyweight exercises: push ups, pull ups, squats, planks and glute bridges. Finish up with stretches for mobility. Yoga is good for this too.\n \nOnce you know more about fitness and your body, you might decide you want the pick up truck body (weightlifters) the sprinter body (sports car) the long distance body (hybrid) or the obstacle course body (jeep). All are worthy goals, but if you're not sure, then start with the Accord."

As a beginner, I had always wanted to build and maintain muscle mass. My ideal shape was athletic, strong.\n \nMy ideal shape was athletic & strong. I had aspired to look like this for a long time and lacked the knowledge and skills to move ahead with my plan.\n \nMy missing puzzle piece was training with weights. I was petrified!\n \nLike most females, I had fallen back into my insecure shell. I\n \nI would watch all these muscle men, with only a couple of women, \npounding, grunting and making faces \n(Actually, I was laughing at the facial expressions!).\n It\u2019s still painful knowing in 2021, there are only a couple of women in the weights area. It\u2019s still a space that men dominate.\nI admit, I was intimidated a lot and stuck to the usual weight bearing machines in the hope that some muscle would grow\u200a\u2014\u200aand maybe I\u2019d get some six-pack in the process, But that never happened, and my frustration continued to grow.\nTaking matters into my own hands was essential - that's why I invested in a personal trainer. It was great, but I didn't get the results I wanted. I didn't dedicate enough time to weight training or even structure my diet correctly.\n \nThat all changed when I decided I wanted to body build seriously and start showing my results on stage. That\u2019s the scary bit\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving your body scrutinised by judges and the audience. I didn\u2019t care; I knew I could build the body I wanted. It was somewhere growing inside of me, and I just needed a proper coach\u200a\u2014\u200aand to commit.\nThen and there, my weight training journey began, and it hasn\u2019t stopped since.\nLearning new things on this journey never stops. There are always pit stops and pivots during the stages of ageing and hormonal shifts. Then when you throw lockdowns in the mix, things can get pretty heated. Here's is the best of the best during my 15-year journey of bodybuilding and nutrition.\n \nUse multi joining movements\n.\n \n(squats, lunges, deadlifts, bench pressing, pull-ups) to use the most muscle groups. These movements develop an athletic, shapely physique, burn more calories, strength and muscle mass. Using this technique every time you train will increase your results and get to your training goals faster. It has never failed me along the bodybuilding journey.\n \nDon't shy away from the intense movements.\n \nI see a lot of people disregarding squats, deadlifts and chin-ups. I know these are challenging, but throwing yourself into challenging movements will create successful results\u200a\u2014\u200aand fast.\n \nThere are instances when your doctor doesn\u2019t recommend a particular exercise\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s fine.\n \nBut what I\u2019d like to point out is that not using these muscle groups will produce weakness in your skeletal system, leading to problems in the future.\n \nI would follow my doctor\u2019s advice, and if I can do something, I\u2019d start very small. As you increase the weights you lift or the intensity of bands. Your body becomes stronger and will tolerate tension and load.\n \nDon\u2019t allow injured muscles to become so weak that they no longer help you lead a normal life. Make use of what you can do to keep strong and active.\n \nNutrition is key to your success.\n \nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you want to get leaner or build muscle\u200a\u2014\u200anutrition is your best friend. Assess your food choices, and adapt according to your needs. Those who want to lose weight will have different requirements than those who build muscle.\n \nOne big question I get is, \"can I do both at the same time?\" Well, sure you can, but one will outweigh the other. Too much cardio can lead to loss of muscle mass. Weight training more than four times a week can lead to less effective results & burnout - and worst still, injury. There needs to be a balance of both mediums.\n \nHow do you discover this balance? No one can tell you what works for your body better than you can. It's a matter of getting into the trenches, trying things out, experimenting and writing down your results.\n \nOver time, you will discover the dos and do not\u2019s of your body. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer for this \u2014 it takes hard work and a lot of guessing \u2014 and it keeps changing as you age.\n \nLet yourself off the hook, throw perfectionism out the window, do your best, and your best is the right place to start.\n \nKnowing what to do and performing it correctly are two different things.\n \nExecuting movements with weights is one of the main reasons why I first hired a personal trainer.\nI wanted someone to tell me exactly what I should do and how to structure my posture correctly.\nI tried to get specific results, and it was easy to get the skills from a person who was already way ahead in the game.\n \nI applied their techniques and skills. Over time, I trained with a couple of other experts who brought even more skills for my success.\n \nThe easiest way to master weight training was because I asked for help. If I had done it myself, it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\n \nThe journey ahead never ends\n.\n \nThere will be endless points in your life where the journey changes.\nWe start to age, we change professions, have a family, experience hormonal shifts or develop an illness.\nThese issues can be very frustrating to anyone that has trained for many years. Things we did ten years ago don't work today.\n \nBut this is life telling us we need to change, alter and find a different way.\n \nThat could mean training a lot less, recovering more, watching your nutrition like a hawk, or trying intermittent fasting. The alternatives are endless, but start with one thing at a time and wait. Along my bodybuilding journey, I ate 5 -6 meals a day.\n \nBack then, I was about 35. Now at 42, I can't handle that many meals, and I'm just not as hungry as I once was. So we just have to make do with what is presented to us right now.\n \nI want to finish this off by saying that when you have a goal In mind, you will then look for the means to attract those results. I always had a set idea of what I wanted.\n \nOnce you've achieved your goal, moving on to something else will keep the flame of fitness alive.\n \nAs we grow up, we develop a love for other things. Perhaps for you, it may be pushing your body to its limit.\n \nMaybe someone else might decide to take up yoga as well. The remarkable aspect of fitness, no matter what age, you can try an array of things to find out what starts to ignite an emotional trigger within you. For me, that's always been weight training.\n \nThere is no other form of exercise that ticks all the boxes for my needs, wants and wishes.\n \nWhat will yours be?\n \nPlease also join me on my various social platforms and do go ahead and download your \n40 Fat Loss Tips & Portions guide.\n I'm also on \nInstagram\n & \nMedium"

In each case, pick the gyms closest to you that you will actually work out in. \n \nI had a home elliptical and a gym 10 feet from my doorstep. I didn't use either much. Now I work out daily because I like my gym and figured out a routine.\n \nWhen I worked in New York, I had two gyms - a free one a work and an Equinox across the street from my home for which I had a work discount. I used both a lot. At one point, the trainer at the work gym said \"Terrence, you don't need to come every day.\" I worked out a lot sometimes. I joined the Reebok gym briefly but it was too far. So even though it was even nicer than Equinox, I worked out more at Equinox.\n \nThe Workout\n. Here's what works for me. I do the 15% max incline on the treadmill in our building's gym. I listen to music, use my iPad and have a water bottle. I do between 20 min to 4 hours of cardio a day, depending. Average is probably 80 minutes. \n \nWhy do I do a 15% incline? Because it is less strain on my knees and back to walk uphill than to run at 0-2% incline. And I can do stuff on my iPad while I'm walking.\n \nAlmost anyone can do this workout. It is super easy. And you can make it hard. Just walk much faster and longer and you'll get a pretty good workout after awhile.\n \nI keep track of my heart rate so its between fat burn and a good burn but not dangerous. Then I try to stretch or lift weights. High reps, low weight. I'm trying to avoid injury so easing into weights. Once I build this into a habit, I will switch it up a bit and do stationary bike, stair climbing, rowing, etc. \n \nRest. \nI take Saturdays off. Mostly because I get up at 5.30am every Saturday to hop on a plane. So I'm already a bit exhausted on most Saturdays. But also partly to stay sane and reward myself. And build a routine I will stick with."

Train 3 times and week for full hour following a suitable progressive overload, using micro plates. Add occasional Front Squats and then add a bit of pull- ups to mix it up a bit. ( you will be sore the first few days!).\n \nOr \ntrain exclusively for 30 days with conventional, sumo and Romanian \ndeadlifts. \nAdd snatch grip deadlifts to the mix for its shock and humbling factor.\n \nTrain 3 time a week, following same procedures mentioned about the squats.\n \nIf you are confusing \nstrength\n with \npower\n, then training with the power cleans you mentioned in your question can help you to build some serious strength and explosive power ( and mass). In future, consider learning the full clean and jerk routine. Olympic lifts build awesome strength and insane ballistic explosive power.\n \n30 days of training with clean and jerk or power cleans is substantial and gives you another notch . Olympic lifts demand extra lifting skills, beyond Squats and Deadlifts.\n \nNutrition and recovery:\n \nYou will be sleeping 8 to 10 hours on schedule, while consuming plenty of clean food and fresh water. Clean food means fresh food.\n \nTry this for the next 30 days and you shall receive your \nextra notch of strength.\n \nA better choice is to chill out and forget the 30 day thing and start incorporating all these lifts into your lifestyle.\n \nStrength training is tough and intense\n!\n \nEDIT:\n \nAttention new trainers\n. Strength training with back squats, front squats and deadlift variations, bench is very intense and you \nwill be sore the day after\n. You may not be able to walk! Next day.\n \nDon't freak out!\n.\n \nIt gets \nbetter\n after few sessions of training. Sleep 8 to 10 hours, focus on your nutrition ( eat more). Go back and train more with good planning."

Make it easy to do on a regular basis. The benefits? Instead of making it intimidating, you make a workout routine doable. Instead of aiming too high and telling yourself you must spend two hours at the gym, you opt for taking baby steps and aim for 15-30 minutes. To get started, just pick a shorter activity that requires your body to move, such as:\na \nmorning yoga routine\na \n15 minute bootcamp session\na set of hindu pushups\na set of \nsun salutation poses\na set of lunges and squats\na 20-minute power walk\na quick run through the neighborhood\nEat for energy.\n \nAlways start your day with breakfast. It's your fuel for starting the day and it helps you to feel alert, energized, and motivated. Choose something that is balanced, light, yet filling, such as a combination of protein, healthy fats, fresh fruit. For example:\nOvernight oats \n(no cooking needed): mix a few spoonfuls of oats, 1 teaspoon each of chia seeds and flax seeds, some walnuts, almonds, raisins; add a bit of almond milk or water to blend; leave in fridge overnight and top it off in the morning with some fresh fruit.\nParfait\n: \nlayer Greek yogurt with granola, nuts (walnuts, almonds, cashews) and diced or sliced fresh fruit (papaya, banana, strawberries, oranges, grapefruit, apples, pears, mango).\nOatmeal \nwith chia seeds, flax seeds, walnuts, almonds, dates, shredded coconut, raisins or cranberries; blend with a spoon of peanut butter and add fresh fruit on top.\nGet more tips on starting positive habits early.\n \nThere\u2019s a podcast that will seriously get you to rethink the way you look at mornings. It's called \nAchieve Your Goals\n and it's hosted by Hal Elrod, the author of a book called \nThe Miracle Morning.\n It is an in depth guide to structuring your mornings so that you can achieve more in less time, and you have time to work consistently on getting closer to your personal goals."

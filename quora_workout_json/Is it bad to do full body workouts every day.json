Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n \nBenefits:\nEfficiency\n: Full-body workouts allow you to target all major muscle groups in a single session, which can be time-efficient.\nIncreased Frequency\n: Training each muscle group more frequently can lead to better muscle growth and strength gains, especially for beginners.\nCaloric Burn\n: More frequent workouts can help with weight management and improving cardiovascular fitness.\nDrawbacks:\nRecovery\n: Muscles need time to recover after workouts. Daily full-body training can lead to fatigue and overtraining, especially if the workouts are intense.\nInjury Risk\n: Without adequate recovery, the risk of injury increases due to wear and tear on muscles and joints.\nPlateaus\n: Constantly doing full-body workouts without variation may lead to plateaus in strength and muscle gains.\nRecommendations:\nListen to Your Body\n: If you feel fatigued or sore, consider taking rest days or alternating with lighter workouts.\nVary Intensity\n: You might do high-intensity workouts a few times a week and lighter sessions or active recovery on other days.\nIncorporate Rest Days\n: Aim for at least one or two rest days per week to allow for muscle recovery.\nUltimately, the best approach depends on your individual goals, fitness level, and how your body responds to training. If you\u2019re unsure, consulting a fitness professional can provide personalized guidance."

You could set experience \novertraining syndrome\n, where your body cannot recover enough between workouts.\n \nAdditionally, your body requires a certain amount of time to recover between workouts. If you\u2019re providing enough stimulus to your muscles this is usually between 36 and 48 hours (\ndepending on the muscle worked (muscles like your core tend to recover faster\n), your gender (\nwomen tend to recover faster than men)\n, the intensity that you worked the muscle (\nthe harder you worked it the longer it will take)\n, your age (\nover 60 you will require as much as 96 hours rest to recover between workouts), \nthe nutrition applied, and your hormone profile (\nmore testosterone, HGH, IGF will lead to quicker recovery when coupled with adequate amounts of protein and glucose\n)).\nIf you don\u2019t give it enough time, you won\u2019t build up past your initial baseline, and your muscles will suffer.\n \nAs metabolic fatigue builds up, even in lighter intensity training, you\u2019ll feel it all over. It could be something simple at first \u2014 you stop improving in your lifts, for example. Eventually you start getting worse. Soon you start getting injuries that aren\u2019t healing. You start to feel depressed. Even one day off with complete relaxation or even a light walk could be enough to clear you out, if you catch it early enough. Serious cases of overtraining could require more time.\n \nTo re-iterate:\nIf you don\u2019t work it over 80% intensity every day\nIf you \ndo\n take a break once every 1\u20132 weeks\nYou\u2019ll be fine.\n \nIf you notice things going wrong \u2014 you start feeling weaker, you stop improving, you start feeling like crap in general, you start getting injuries\u2026take a step back. Rest. Recover.\nBrief anecdote as illustration\n \nOnce I was really working my pull ups. I was stuck at 18. I would do them daily, at least 4 sets. I hit 18 every time in my first set, I ended up doing about 50 a day. At first I was gaining daily, I went from 8 to 10 to 14, to 18\u2026but then the growth stopped. I was stuck there for a couple weeks.\n \nI took 2 days off from doing pull ups.\n \nThe next time I stepped up to the bar I did 25 in my first set.\n \nI\u2019m not saying that you\u2019ll have dramatic results like this, but sometimes the missing part of your workout is actually \nnot\n working out."

By hitting each muscle 3 times a week but giving your body more rest overall allows more muscle growth. Also I used to waste a lot of time working on isolation exercises and wasn't doing much the second half of the workouts anyways I still do a little mobility, stretching and walking on off days. I have made a lot of progress and the effort throughout the week is much less. It's crazy! With that being said it's still good to switch it up. I'll do an upper/lower or push/pull/legs split time to time."

Besides, gym time is still considered a waste, \u201cwhy\u201d they will tell you, \u201cwaste 6-7 days a week at the gym when you could exercise less and enjoy life more?\u201c Browsing on social media 3 hours a day is considered more normal. It has nothing to do with sports science, it is ideology.\n \nTell me which one is more taxing on the body: Lifting weights where you spend more than 2/3 of your time resting, or an NBA game? Athletes play up to 4 games a week, plus training, you think you cannot handle doing flys, curls, pulldowns, and basic human movements everyday? In all other sports, lifting weights is the supplement to the main sport, and the average gym goer believes s/he has to have full 3-4 rest days a week to maximize benefits and train hard, how pathetic is that? I know those other guys are athletes, it's their job, etc. But we are talking about the capacities of the human body. You can improve your work load capacity. I'm not saying that everyone can or should be an athlete, but an hour of training a day is nowhere close to an athlete's schedule. Athletes typically have up to 15 sessions a week, each around 2.5 hours. Ask olympic weightlifters and they will tell you. Even some bodybuilders, like Jay Cutler, have been known to train twice a day. One of the most respected academicians in sports science, Mike Israetel, also says you can train more than 7 times a week if you have the time and proper schedule that allows for it. Several months ago, he had three sessions a day himself. \u201cRecovery,\u201d in other words, can be handled pretty well.\n \nAnd now people will pull the \u201cnatural\u201d card. It is actually the natural lifters who should train as often as possible to increase protein synthesis. You could get away with training each bodypart once a week if you were on steroids, but that's not the case if you are natural. Keep the sessions short and intense, stimulate your muscles and don't annihilate your joints, so you can train the same muscle group as often as possible. That will give you enough weekly volume to grow.\n \nAnd certain muscle groups can be trained almost everyday. Posture muscles (abs, traps), smaller muscles that won't tax your entire body and do not get heavily involved in big compounds (side/rear delts, calves, biceps) can be trained almost everyday. Bigger muscles can be trained 2-4 times a week. If you schedule smartly, it is perfectly fine.\n \nHere\n is a good example by Christian Thibaudeau. It is 6 days a week, but you get the idea."

The best I ever got was after working in Slovakia for a few months, where I only trained at weekends. I returned to Thailand and subsequently won my 1st race back.\n \nWell that turned out to be my only 1st place - although I still got the occasional podium after resuming overtraining.\n \nI stopped racing and started back in the gym about 5 years ago. Every other day, I gradually improved but never got near to where I was before.\n \nAlmost 3 years ago I had a change of circumstances and now train at most 5 times a fortnight- and often only have time twice a week.\n \nI can't squat shit anymore, or bench press nearly as much either but on curls I'm only about 10kg off my best- and my best was 25 years ago!\n \nDorian Yates famously said : \u201c If training 10 hours a day and eating dog shit was the way to be a winner, I'd have done it. As it is you need first to shock your muscles and then let them rebuild, this takes longer than 24 hours\u201d.

Sign me up!\nMore frequent \npractice \nwith the movements-that could explain why the bench results were very similar above (simple movement) but the full body group got better squat gains (more complex movement). They just had more \npractice\n.\nSorry\u2026I just love that video.\n \nFull body routine disadvantages\nThey\u2019re \nhard\n. This is BY FAR the main reason people gravitate towards bro splits. Mentally, going into the gym and working your entire body just is on another plane of existence in terms of difficulty compared to just working one chunk of muscle, even if the volume is the same. It\u2019s easy to tap out when you have to do front squats, RDLs, bench press, overhead press, seated rows, pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, extensions and ab wheel all in the same day.\nPerhaps because of this, they can be tough on your \nhormone levels\n. Check the above chart; the full body testosterone went up 11%, but the split went up 21%! Keep in mind this was just four weeks, working out just three times per week, as well. Keeping up a full body protocol all the time, for higher volumes could \nprobably \nlead to reductions in T for some people.\nThey give you \nless time \nto \nrecover\n. This is part of the reason that I really am sure to use a lot of variety in my training when incorporating higher frequency. If you use the same movements all the time, be prepared for your joints to be unhappy. You need to vary the movement patterns enough that it shifts the stress on the joints at least slightly.\nSplit routine advantages\nMore \nrecovery time \nfor each body part between workouts.\nMight have better satellite cell activation (check the answer below) due to the \nincreased concentrated workload \nand greater \nmuscle damage\n. \nGeoffrey Verity Schofield's answer to How fast does lost muscle grow back with muscle memory?\nGet a \nbetter pump\n-doing more work in one session can lead to greater metabolic stress for that muscle.\nCan help you develop a better \nmind-muscle connection. \nYes, that\u2019s a real thing, especially for the upper body.\nCauses increased \nsoreness\n, which can facilitate growth and let you \u201cfeel\u201d that muscle better. This could be a disadvantage if you don\u2019t like this feeling\u2026I personally kinda like it for some twisted reason.\nSplit routine disadvantages\nLower frequency \nper muscle group. This is probably the biggest reason why split routines suck. You do chest on Monday (obviously), and your chest is really only growing for about 36\u201348hours afterwards. There are 168 hours of the week-why would you only have each muscle group growing 20\u201330% of the time? \nNot optimal! \nFull body routines can get that number up to 70\u201380+% for the entire body, which explains the massive difference in both muscle gain and fat loss.\nYou \ncan \nactually \nLOSE muscle\n. In the above example, you\u2019re growing on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. You might be maintaining on Thursday and Friday. But especially if you are cutting or not getting in enough protein, or not sleeping well, it\u2019s entirely possible for the weekend to be in a catabolic state.\nNot that kind of Weaknd; he\u2019s in a catabolic state 24/7\nYou can \nlose \u201ctouch\u201d \nwith an exercise. This isn\u2019t gonna happen with bicep curls or lateral raises, but with something like squatting or Olympic lifting, it\u2019s entirely possible for the nervous system to slightly forget how to do these movements if you\u2019re only doing them once per week.\nAll in all, I\u2019d do full body \nmost \nof the time, but if you hit a plateau, splitting up your routine can be a nice change of pace.\n \nYou\u2019ll have more time to recover, and can really focus on blasting a body part to force it to grow, perhaps through the aforementioned satellite cells. You can recover any hormonal or structural stress incurred during your full body bonanza.\n \nI\u2019ve taken a page out of Eric Helm\u2019s book\nand been doing full body workouts 4\u20136 times a week recently, and it\u2019s been astonishingly effective.

But that is for people with especially good recovery abilities.\n \nIt amazes me how much the bodybuilding industry has confused the shit out of people. Telling them to workout 6 times per week, eat 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and other useless nonsense. Sure that works for the guys taking steroids, but all it does for a natural trainer is lead them nowhere. Yeah, you might experience results in a few months, but after that you\u2019ll stagnate.\n \nFull-body workouts on the other hand, are the perfect routines for natural trainers. They offer enough volume, but not too much to where you can\u2019t recover from. In addition, you\u2019re joints and central nervous system get more of a break and time to recover because you\u2019re not training as often.\n \nAll you need in a full-body workout is a major push, a major pull, and a major legs exercise. The intermediate and advance could also benefit from some assistance exercises for the arms and calves. But other than that, this is all you will ever need to grow. I currently am 6\u20321 and weigh 203 lbs, at 11 percent body fat. And I have been on a maintenance routine only lifting weights twice per week and sprinting on a third day. I haven\u2019t gained any mass (hence the maintenance routine) but I still have continued to gain strength. One of my example workouts was this:\n \nWeighted Dips: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nWeighted Chin-ups: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nSquats: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nCalf raises and forearms: 2\u20133 sets of 10\u201315 reps\n \nWill you get to be 250 at 5 % body fat and become some absolute beast?? Hell no, not even close. But no natural trainer will ever get that close. If you are around 6 feet tall, the most you can ever expect to weight at 10 percent body fat is probably 215 to 220. And those numbers are for someone with very great genetics.\n \nI love how people think they need to follow the split routines 6 days per week because everyone else is doing it.\n \nWell, how many people do you see that are big and strong? Not many. How many people do you see at the gym following those splits who are actually big and NOT taking steroids?

The simple sugars in the refined grain tempts the cells to open taking in more of the protein maximizing muscle growth.\n \nIn the afternoon when I returned home from work I would have a snack of peanuts and fresh squeezed cider while doing some arm exercises. The peanuts supplied fat, protein and so many vitamins and minerals as well as arginine. A cup of peanuts has more than 3X the arginine as a most whey servings supplying 40 grams of protein. The natural sugar in the cider opened up the cells sucking in the nutrients while the arginine dilates the cardiovascular system. Before going to bed I would maybe 6 ounces of peanuts and have a glass of apple juice while doing enough arm exercises to get the pump back in.\n \nI was really doing a full workout in the morning, a teaser when I got home from work, a full workout at the gym, and enough to flush and pump my arms just before bed. I ate yogurt, steak, eggs, sardines, baked potatoes, salads, cooked vegetables, whole grain breads, almonds, walnuts, I ate humongous amounts of foods but when I started eating the peanuts and drinking the cider I found the gains in strength and size came much more quickly."

Ali has decided to do 8 sets of 3 reps with 250kg (83%) on his main squat day, Monday. He also does front squats on Wednesday, up to 180kg 3x3 and paused squats on Friday, 200kg 5x5. His workout goes as follows.\n \n20kg x 20\n50kg x 10\n80kg x 5\n120kg x 5\n160kg x 3\n200kg x 3\n220kg x 1\n240kg x 1\n250kg x 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n \nThat\u2019s a total of 16 sets. Ali takes 8 minutes of rest between the work sets, 3 minutes between the lighter warmup sets and 5 between the heavier ones. That\u2019s about 90 minutes of rest total, so we\u2019re looking at close to 2 hours, just for squats.\n \nNow, at this point his focus and attention are beginning to flag, his legs tire and he\u2019s getting hungry. Time to stop. Bench presses will have to wait until Tuesday.\n \nIf you\u2019re not at Ali\u2019s level, there is probably little benefit to splitting up your workout."

If you\u2019re doing the same reps with the same weight, eventually your body is going to get bored because there is no challenge. It already built up the muscle and strength needed to lift that weight.\n \nThere\u2019s no reason for your body to progress because it can handle the stress you are giving it through your workout.\n \nJust like the video games you enjoyed, you need to hit the next level to see results.\n \nLEVERS OF PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD\nWhen it comes to progressive overload there are a few levers you can adjust to increase the challenge.\n \nWeight\n: Arguably the most used and abuse lever. The concept is simple, add more weight to the bar.\n \nReps\n: Increase the number of reps you can lift a certain weight for.\n \nSets\n: Increase the number of sets per exercise.\n \nTime Under Tension\n: Increase the time your muscles need to support the weight.\n \nRest Periods\n: Decreasing the time between sets.\n \nTraining Frequency\n: Adding another day of hitting a muscle group without being debilitatingly sore.\n \nEach week work one of these levers to add progressive overload to your muscles.\n \nBut this is when it starts getting hairy because a haphazard approach could lead to gainz in the short term. Unfortunately, muscle isn\u2019t built in the short term, it\u2019s a long term project so you\u2019ll need a plan.\n \nTHE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD METHOD\nThere\u2019s a few different methods for ensuring progressive overload in your workouts. The most basic one is called a Single Progression method.\n \nSingle (or Linear) Progression Method:\n Basically each workout you increase the weight on a lift.\n \nLet\u2019s say you can bench 225 for 8 reps.\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 230 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 3: 235 for 8 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nOn paper this is pretty sweet. But for anyone that has ever lifted a weight ever, you know damn well shit doesn\u2019t go that smoothly.\n \nEventually, you\u2019ll hit a point where you can\u2019t get 8 reps with good form. You\u2019ll get 5 solid reps and 3 cockeyed-am-I-gonna-die reps.\n \nSide Note: IMO this is a piss-poor way to progress. It\u2019s very short sighted.\n \nDouble Progression Method:\n In this method you increase reps first then weight.\n \nSay you can bench 225 lbs for 8 reps.\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 225 for 9 reps\n \nWeek 3: 225 for 10 reps\n \nWeek 4: 235 for 8 reps\n \nWeek 5: 235 for 9 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nI like this method much better than the Single Progression because it allows you to get stronger and \u201cmilk\u201d the results from a certain weight.\n \nFor this, I like to work in rep brackets rather than just a target number of reps per set. Instead of saying 3 sets of 10 reps, I would give my clients something like 3 sets of 8-10 reps or change the desired reps in each workout within that bracket.\nThis way you have a range to progress and you know where the ceiling is to increase the weight. Once you hit the top of the range on all your sets, drop the reps to the bottom of the bracket and increase the weight.\n \nThis is the best for busy individuals with time restriction to their workouts. It takes an extra min to add another rep to each set.\n \nTriple Progression Method: \nIn this method you first increase the reps, then sets and finally weight.\n \nBringing back our benching example:\n \nWeek 1: 225 for 3 sets of 8 reps\n \nWeek 2: 225 for 3 sets of 9 reps\n \nWeek 3: 225 for 3 sets of 10 reps\n \nWeek 4: 225 for 4 sets of 8 reps\n \nWeek 5: 225 for 4 sets of 9 reps\n \nWeek 6: 225 for 4 sets of 10 reps\n \nWeek 7: 235 for 3 sets of 8 reps\n \nEtc.\n \nFor this method I would still keep the rep bracket and only increase 1 set before increasing the weight. Depending on how many exercises you do this on, you can easily add another 10-15 mins to your workout.\n \nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU USE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD\n \nThe first week of a new workout is the feeling out process.\n \nFinding the right weight for each exercise, how the exercise sequence flows with the flow of everyone else in the gym (i.e. are you waiting on equipment) and learning the right form for new exercises.\n \nLet\u2019s assume we are using a double progression method here.\n \nSo for week 1, I always tell my clients do the workout as-is and pick a weight where you get close to failure at the lower end of a rep bracket.\n \nIn week 2 you\u2019ll know what to expect and we can start pushing a little more. Try increasing reps on all sets.\n \nWeek 3 through whenever: Once you can hit the top of the rep bracket on all the sets. Increase the weight and drop the reps back down.\n \nNow if you change your workout every 4 weeks you probably won\u2019t be able to see the increase in weight right away. Odds are you\u2019ll still be trying to increase the reps by the end of the fourth week.\n \nWhich is fine. It\u2019s still progressive overload and you\u2019re still getting closer to your goal.\n \nIf you like your workout, stick to it. There\u2019s no harm in going 6-7-8 weeks with one workout program. If anything you\u2019ll get really good at those particular lifts and not to \nmention stronger\n.\n \nAfter about 12 weeks or so, I would say you need to switch the exercises up a little just because you\u2019ll be building weaknesses in the areas that aren\u2019t the focus of your particular workout. Plus, if you\u2019re doing something like heavy squatting for 12 consecutive weeks your hips and knees will need a break.\n \nWILL YOU PROGRESS EVERY WEEK?\n \nAbsolutely not.\n \nSome workouts are just going to suck.\n \nOthers are going to be a cake walk.\n \nThe fact of the matter is that you have a lot of shit going on in your life which can drain some gym energy. The important thing is to try to do more each week.\n \nSometimes you\u2019ll get there. And the more and more you advance into your weight lifting career the harder it is to make progress.\n \nIf you\u2019re a gym noob, I would expect week over week improvement for the first 6 months or so.\n \nIf you\u2019re a little more advanced I would expect every couple of weeks you\u2019ll see in increase.\n \nIf you\u2019re\n advanced\n, first off I have zero idea why you\u2019d be reading this, but anyways\u2026If you\u2019re advanced once every couple of months seeing an increase.\n \nAnd that is progressive overload. Now go build some muscles.\n \nAesthetic Physiques"

Cholesterade is an all natural and great tasting soluble fiber supplement with 7g of fiber per serving. Increasing the fiber will not only clean you out, but it will lower your cholesterol, lower your blood sugar, normalize your blood pressure and will give you more of a full feeling at meal time which will allow you to eat less, thus creating healthy weight loss.

This addiction started at the age of 13 when my father bought me my first weight set. I am currently 21 years old. In the 8 years that I have spent training, I've read dozens of books regarding training, read and watched thousands of videos in that time aswell.\nHere an some interesting facts about myself:\n \nI\u2019ve performed over a million push-ups in my life.\nBack to your question about two days a week full body workout. Here's a excerpt from the book \nDinosaur Training: LOST SECRETS OF STRENGTH AND DEVELOPMENT.\nDinosaur training sessions are short, hard and infrequent. A typical session will consist of no more than twenty sets, with at least half of those sets being progressively heavier warm-ups. The average number of sets per workout would be between eight and fifteen. Some sessions will consist of only four or five sets. A typical week will see the dinosaur training only two or three times. That means the dinosaur trains his entire body with well under fifty sets PER WEEK. It also means the dinosaur will spend no more than three hours per week on his training. I refer to this type of training as abbreviated training.\n \nThere are two basic ways to implement abbreviated training. One way is to work the entire body in each workout. For example, you might train on Monday and Thursday. On Monday you would do squats, benches, pulldowns and seated military presses. On Thursday you would do HAMMER STRENGTH leg presses, stiff legged deadlifts, chins, dips and standing curls with a barbell. Thus, you are doing a total body workout every time you train, but you are doing different movements in each session and only working each particular exercise one time per week.\n \nThe second way to implement abbreviated training is to train each basic exercise only one time per week. and do only two or three basic exercises per session. For example, you might do squats and benches on Monday, followed by presses, pulldowns and dips on Wednesday, followed by deadlifts or cleans, shrugs and barrel lifting on Friday.\n \nIn either approach, the sets, reps and exercises are up to the discretion and personal preference of the lifter. Either system allows you to do high rep death marches with a heavy poundage ... to do five sets of five reps ... to do heavy singles ... to do rack work or anything else that strikes your fancy.\n \nIf you prefer to get more rest between training sessions, schedule your program over a ten day or two week period. For example, take two workouts over a ten day period instead of two workouts over a seven day period. Or train three times in two weeks rather than three times in one week. The variations are endless.\nJust to make things easier for you, here's a great schedule:\n \nDAY ONE\n (sets x reps)\n \n1. Squat 4x5\n 2. Standing Press 4x5\n 3. Bent-over Barbell Row 4x5\n 4. Farmer's Walk (one time)\n 5. Bent-legged situps 2x8-15\n 6. Auxiliary work for neck, biceps or calves (optional)\n \nDAY TWO\n \n1. Bent-legged Deadlift, Stiff-legged Deadlift, Power Clean, Power Pull, or Power Snatch 4 x 5 (or 5 x 3 for cleans, pulls or snatches)\n 2. Bench Press (barbell or dumbbell) (or floor press) 4x5\n 3. Sandbag Walk (one time)\n \n4. Side-bends 2x8-15\n 5. Auxiliary work as on Day One (optional)\n \nSounds simple, doesn't it? That's because it IS simple. Hard? Just try it.\n \nPerseverance, patience and determination will be repaid in untold wealth, health, strength, self-reliance and fortitude. \nGeorge F. Jowett"

            "text": "The most effective workout routine for building muscle mass follows a simple formula.\n \nCompound Workouts + Calorie Surplus + Recovery = Muscle Mass.\n Each part of this equation will need equal attention if your aim is to pack on muscle in the most efficient way possible. There are many ways to the top of the mountain but this method has worked for me over the past 15 years strength training whilst working full-time at a desk job.\n \nCompound Workouts\n \nI choose the bang-for-your buck compounds like squats, deadlifts, bench press and bent over rows. Spreading this out intelligently throughout the week will allow my muscles to recovery, adapt and ultimately grow. As I\u2019m in the office 3 days a week (with access to a gym) my current routine is as follows:\n \nDay 1:\n \nBarbell Bench Press 12/10/8/8\n \nDB Flys 12/12/12\n \nBarbell Rows 12/10/8/8\n \nLat Pull Down 12/12/12\n \nBarbell Military Press 12/10/8/8\n \nBarbell Upright Rows 12/12/12\n \nDay 2:\n \nBarbell Squat 12/10/8/8\n \nBarbell Lunge 12/12/12\n \nDeadlift 12/10/8/6\n \nSmith Machine Calf Raise 15/15/15\n \nDay 3:\n \nIncline Dumbell Chest Press 12/12/12\n \nClose Grip Pull Downs 12/12/12\n \nSeat Arnold Press 12/12/12\n \nCable Curls/Tricep Pull Downs Superset 12/12/12/12\n \nLying Leg Raises x20\n \nAngels & Devils 1 min\n \nThings to keep in mind when executing the workout:\nAlways control the weight (do not let the weight control you)\nThink about what muscles are contracting and focus your power there\nAlways have a tight core with each movement - this creates a stable base for each exercise and reduces risk of injury\nRest 60\u201390 seconds between each set\nCalorie Surplus\n \nYou will need to consume more calories than you are burning to build muscle (the opposite is true if you want to shed some weight).\n \nThere is a bit of work upfront as you\u2019ll need to find your baseline and track how much food you are eating. A good starting point are the numerous BMR calculators available (I use the MyFitnessPal one) and then adjust based on the amount of activity you undertake during the day (I use my smart watch to give me guides).\n \nWhen I first started I was surprised at how much more I actually needed to eat to exceed the calories I was burning. Adding a protein shake between meals has helped get these numbers up.\n \nRecovery\n \nThe final ingredient and arguably the most important.\n \nIf you don\u2019t let your muscles (and body) recover then it will not be able to adapt to the stimulus your workout has provided. Muscles grow when you rest so recover harder than you train. Prioritise your sleep and make sure you listen to your body\u2019s needs.\n \nWhen your body is recovered your workouts can be executed with a greater intensity and that will ultimately be the most effective if you want to build muscle.\n \nSO\n\u2026the most effective workout routine to build muscle incorporates:\nCompound Lifts executed 3 days a week\nCalorie Surplus - fueling your body more than it burns\nRecover - give time for your muscles to grow\nI hope that helps. Enjoy the journey!"

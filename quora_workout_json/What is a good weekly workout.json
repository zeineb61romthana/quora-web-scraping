If you don't like running or yoga, then don't do them.

Don't do high reps. When you lift heavy weights, you are forced to use good technique and pay attention. For this reason, heavier weights are safer. With light weights, people just mindlessly do reps and eventually develop elbow tendinitis or some other easily preventable condition. \n \nOn run days, \nfor best results\n, don't just jog for 40 minutes straight. Do sprints, intervals, or do a stop-and-go-run where you go for a sprint, slow to a walk, and repeat over and over. Acceleration requires the most energy AND it will illicit a hormone response favorable to fat loss (weight loss is not all about calories!)\n \nHope that helps,\n \nNate"

If you only have an hour a day to dedicate to improving your body, exercise is a great start.

Weight loss/fat loss/overall heatlh is like 75% diet, 25% exercise.  So you'll need to do some research on that first (some great sources are eattoperform or bengreenfieldfitness to start).\n \nAs for a weekly plan....  Honestly, I'm apprehesive to suggest anything specific simply because I don't know you or your body and how you respond to movement.  The exercises you mentioned - dance, strength, yoga and running - are all very effective in helping with gaining strength and improving cardio health.  I say try one each day and see what you're drawn to.  You can also try high intensity training (also known at HIT or HIIT).  Even try studios like Orangetheory, Pure Barre, even Crossfit.  See what you'll like and what you're willing to continue with. What piques your interest is what you'll be willing to dedicate your time to and work for.\n \nI do agree that running for weight loss is a tricky topic.  I suggest you do more research on it.  But doing sprints and tempo runs work really well with increasing VO2 max capacities and help bring you into a fat burning mode instead of sugar burning (this is ben greenfield's aim).  \n \nAlternate your workouts.  Don't forget to build in rest.  And working out a solid hour a day HARD isn't necessary.  Get your heart rate up 20-30 minutes a day for strength training and cardio.  Work your body hard during that short time...push yourself.  It'll be more effective than spending an hour in the gym mindlessly lifting weights.  Give yourself some bodywork therapy (pilates, yoga) to balance out the other workouts (those can be an hour - 90 min).   \n \nFinally, while I don't feel comfortable giving  you a specific workout, I can tell you what's worked for me in the past:\n \nDay 1 - strength training (20-30) with a trainer...hard\n \nDay 2 - sprint or tempo work\n \nDay 3 - Pilates\n \nDay 4 - strength training\n \nDay 5 - spring or tempo work \n \nDay 6 - Yoga\n \nDay 7 - Rest\n \nSince I'm a Pilates instructor, I usually do Pilates mat/props 5-6 days a week.  But those listed on the above schedule are sessions in the studio either guided by another instructor or myself on the machinery.   \n \nSo...\nfind studios/workouts/trainers that you'll stick with which also push you\ndo strength training and hard cardio 20-30 min on those designated days\ntry hour long classes for dance, yoga, and pilates\ndon't forget to rest\nwork your diet to support your new activities\nGood luck!!"

You can probably do it too.\n \nHow are you doing getting up off the floor? If this is hard for you you need to ask Mr Google for some exercises to strengthen your legs for getting up off the floor.\n \nMostly I will say this. If your doctor recommends you do physical therapy, not only do the therapy it continue doing the exercise after the therapy ends.

What type of training have you done before? What is your current physical condition? What type of exercise do you enjoy (so that you will stick with it)? All of those questions need to be answered before an accurate answer can be given. However, as a general approach:\n \nA three day full body routine would be a great place for anyone new to it, or any experienced gym goers looking for a change. Focus on compound movements for your legs, back, shoulders, chest and hinge movements:\n \nSo one day could be leg press, pull-ups, dumbbell overhead press, bench press and straight leg deadlifts - another could be squats, dumbbell rows, dips, dumbbell incline bench press, good mornings.\n \nExercise choice is up to you, but concentrate on those five areas and compound movements as they recruit the most muscle fibres. Use free weights, not machines, because machines will not give you nearly enough stress on the muscle to make significant changes. Bodyweight moves could be used instead if you are not comfortable using weights to begin wuth.\n \nCardio will be important too. Best bet is high intensity interval training (HIIT), which could be done on days you are not in the gym.\n \nHope that helps."

You need the right balance of protein/carbs/low fat and try to stay away from sugar and empty calories like alcohol. You need to eat little and often, I always have packets of dried apricots/prunes/dates nearby and a packet of almonds. These help to reach your (at least) 5-a day fruit/veg and help me reach my daily protein target.\n \nSupplements wise, I use Whey protein and Creatine.

Whether you're looking to shed some pounds, build muscle, or boost your overall health, finding the right workout is key to sustaining motivation and achieving your goals. Let's dive into the world of fitness and shed light on how to choose the best workout tailor-fitted to your needs and lifestyle.\n \nUnderstanding Your Fitness Goals\n \nBefore jumping into the latest fitness craze, it's essential to get a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. Here's how to set realistic and personal goals:\nWeight Loss:\n If your aim is to lose weight, focus on workouts that enhance \ncardiovascular health\n and burn significant calories, such as HIIT, running, or spinning classes.\nMuscle Gain:\n For those looking to gain muscle mass, strength training and resistance exercises like weightlifting or bodyweight exercises will be your go-to.\nEndurance Building:\n Sports such as swimming, cycling, or long-distance running can increase your stamina and improve heart and lung function.\nFlexibility and Balance:\n Yoga and Pilates provide a perfect blend of stretching and core workouts to enhance these areas.\nOnce your goals are outlined, consider how each workout aligns with your lifestyle and how they can be incorporated into your daily regime.\n \nConsidering Workout Preferences and Lifestyle\n \nYour workout should not only meet your fitness goals but also jive with your interests and schedule. Consistency will become infinitely easier if you enjoy the process. Ask yourself:\nDo you prefer solitary workouts where you can go at your own pace, like jogging or solo weight training sessions?\nAre group classes such as Zumba, spinning, or CrossFit more motivating and fun for you?\nDoes your routine allow long workout periods, or are shorter, more intense sessions like Tabata training better?\nBalance is vital\u2014not just on the yoga mat but also in scheduling workouts that fit into your life seamlessly.\n \nWorkout Types: Pros, Cons, and Who They're Best For\n1. HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)\n \nPros:\nEfficient, burns many calories in a short period\nBoosts metabolism for hours after the workout\nCons:\nMay be challenging for beginners\nHigher risk of injury if not done with proper form\nBest for:\n Individuals with limited time seeking fast results.\n \n2. Cardiovascular Exercises (Running, Cycling)\n \nPros:\nImproves heart health and burns calories\nCan be done anywhere\nCons:\nCan be monotonous\nImpact on joints\nBest for:\n Beginners to advanced; those who enjoy outdoor activities.\n \n3. Strength Training (Gym Workouts, Calisthenics)\n \nPros:\nBuilds muscle and strength\nIncreases metabolism\nCons:\nRequires equipment or gym access\nProgress may be slower\nBest for:\n Those looking to tone up or increase strength.\n \n4. Yoga and Pilates\n \nPros:\nImproves flexibility and core strength\nReduces stress\nCons:\nMay not burn as many calories\nRequires patience and discipline\nBest for:\n Individuals seeking a low-impact option focusing on mental and physical well-being.\n \nIncorporating Recovery and Nutrition\nRemember that the best workout routine is incomplete without proper recovery and nutrition. Always schedule rest days to allow your body to recover, and fuel your workouts with a balanced diet rich in proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and micronutrients. Hydration is also non-negotiable\u2014keep the water flowing!\n \nConclusion\n \nThe best workout for you is one that you enjoy, that fits your lifestyle, and that moves you towards your fitness objectives. Assess your preferences, experiment with different types, and listen to your body's responses. Dedication to progress rather than perfection will lead to sustainable health benefits and personal satisfaction.\n \nRemember to consult with fitness professionals and possibly get a health check-up before starting a new workout regime. Their guidance can help you modify workouts to your level, increasing both effectiveness and safety.\n \nAs you begin this journey, celebrate every step forward. Whether it's a faster mile, a heavier lift, or simply the discipline to show up to your yoga mat\u2014each accomplishment is a testament to your commitment to a healthier you.\n \nBegins with these \n5 key principles you must apply\n in order to STOP the rapid onset of aging that's going on right now, reverse it, and begin \"aging backwards\" by restoring your body's natural youth hormones."

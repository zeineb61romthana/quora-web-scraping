Cardio exercises are important for heart and lungs , which you can\u2019t skip. 20 high Jumps , Running , jogging is preferred.\nStretches : I strongly recommend having emphasis on maximum body stretches, it\u2019ll increase your functionality in upcoming exercises.\nPush Ups : Keep your hands at same distance as broad as your shoulder width for starters , at least 20 push ups recommended but don't be disappointed if you can\u2019t . It isn't because you are weak it is because you are not in practice.Also Push Ups with less distance between your hands = Good for triceps and shoulders , Push Ups with more gap between your hands = Good for chest . Including 2\u20133 types of Push Ups recommended.\nPull Ups : Have a bar and do as much pull ups exercise as you can , and if you can\u2019t just try again and again . You will increase repetations eventually with time .\nWeight exercises : If you have weights, biceps curls and shoulder press exercises are adviced . Weight training is important part of workout routine but it optional in the start and you can include it in your routine in future.\nImportant Tips :\nDon\u2019t include too much exercises in the start. More than one exercise for single body part won't make that muscle making process shorter but will exhaust your energy and time.\nStart from your efficiency with less exercises in beginning and increase repetitions and exercises with time.\nDon't think about the result , Trust the process!!!. Enjoy workout routine and only include exercise that you like. (For beginners) . (We don't want our body to get tired early of the routine.)\nYou don't need protein powder or any extra supplement apart from the daily food you get. Just eat much you want but there should be 4\u20135 hours at least gap between workout time and food time. Eat any junk food much you want but remember once in a month, don't eat on regular basis . It makes you lazy .\nMost important thing is \u201cRest\u201d. Do take 8 hours sleep at least . Do Workout 4 days a week . Remember your don't get muscle in workout time but it builds muscle when you sleeping.\nStart today, be consistent. Good wishes to you .\n \nDo up vote the answer if it helped.\n \nPic Source : Google images."

Workout on that for a week or 2 and learn the basic movements, how to push the weights in order to target the right muscle and to which extent in order to avoid injury. Second machine would be a pectoral fly machine. Use both these muscles under the supervision of a trainer and learn about the proper movements before using the barbells/dumbbells for dumbbell press (substitution for chest-press machine) and dumbbell fly (for pectoral fly machine)\n \n2)BACK (2nd major muscle)\n \nBe very cautious while doing back exercises as even a small injury in your lower back can cause physical problems for you for many years. Be cautious about your posture while doing any back exercise which means standing straight (or knees bent in some exercises) and contracting your traps while pushing your chest outwards and keeping your lower back straight by pushing your hips outwards (in exercises in which you are supposed to bend your knees). THIS APPLIES TO EVERY BACK EXERCISE.\n \nAs on first day, do lat pull down, seated rowing, dumbbell shrugs and bent over rowing.\n \n3)LEGS (The 3rd major muscle)\n \nDon\u2019t go heavy on squats for the first month if you\u2019re starting gym for the first time in life. Do body-weight squats or simply barbell squats (without lading the weights) to learn to balance and get your leg muscles working. Use leg-press machines and leg extensions to workout your quadriceps and leg curl and seated calf raises to workout your hamstrings and calves respectively for first few weeks.\n \n4)Shoulders\n \nInstead of doing lifting exercises, do raising ones like dumbbell front raise, lateral raise, bent over lateral raise.\n \n5) Arms (Biceps and Triceps)\n \nThere is not really much to pay attention while working out your arms except for the posture while doing biceps dumbbell/barbell curl \u2018coz people tend to use a jerk while lifting which leads to bending the waist backwards which in some cases results very dangerous if the weight is heavy.\n \nHope it helps..Happy gyming.."

Soon your body well get use to your body weight and will become easy.\n \n3. CHIN UP: Chin up is a little different from pull ups. Here ur palms are facing towards u and the gap between two hand is less and arms are parallel to each other unlike in pull up position where arms form a V shape. This focuses on \nBICEPS, FOREARMS, BACK.\n \n4. PUSH UP: This is one of the basic exercise for upper body. U can change hand position to apply focus on different parts.\n \n-- WIDE GRIP : Focuses on CHEST, BICEPS\n-- CLOSE GRIP : Focuses on CHEST, TRICEPS\n \nU can increase the intensity of workout by making it difficult by keeping ur legs on elevated platform.\n \n5. BICYCLE CRUNCH : Best for abdomen. U can google it to see how it is done.\n \n6. PLANK : Its a really challenging exercise requires mental stamina. Hold on to it as long as u can and every day try to beat ur previous target. focuses on ABDOMEN, BACK, SHOULDERS.\n \n7. -- SIT UPS : For upper abs \n -- LEG RAISE : For lower abs\n \n8. SQUATS : Squats with hands behind ur head is very good for THIGHS, HIPS.\nIts word be better if u have some weight on urself to increase intensity.\n \n9. CALF RAISES: Standing on ur toes and coming back. Its best if u have some weight on.\n \nThese exercise will cover almost all major body parts and u can do them separately day wise or mix it up as u like it.\n \nDIET : Diet is vey important part of working out. Remember its not the exercise but the food which makes u grow. \n- As u have mentioned you are skinny then make it a point to eat a lot.\n- No need to take supplements coz working out at home wont require that much.\n- Increase number of meal and don't stay hungry. Eat after every four hours. And eat HEALTY \n- Include bananas, sprouts, eggs whites ( eat at least 6 ), Almonds, Milk , Chicken( prefer boiled leg and chest pieces)\n- Eat everything which ur mom cooks.\n- Keep monitoring ur weight and check for results and act accordingly\n \nHope this helps you and u get in good shape."

Don\u2019t work on specific muscle groups for several days to avoid injuries. Try to count your repetitions and sets. For the basics, you may want to do 8 to 10 repetitions of any of the exercises mentioned, per set. Also, you could start with 3 to 4 sets."

If you cannot manage the push-ups, then drop your knees to the ground and push from there. Another starting progression if you cannot complete a \u201cfull\u201d push-up is to just focus on doing the downward part of the movement - usually, you will reach a point where you end up just flopping down the rest of the way\u2026 try to avoid banging your nose on the floor, it will hurt\u2026 but if you put as much effort into the downward part as you can and get as low as you can on every rep, and then finish with the flop every rep, and just reset back to the top of the movement, you will eventually manage to get all the way down without flopping. Then you just have to do the push, which will be hard, but give it 100% and then stop and reset as needed.\n \nNext, bodyweight squats. Sit on a kitchen chair, or the toilet, or a comfortable chair if you really want to. Without using your arms, lean forward and stand up. Once you are fully upright, sit back down again but do not let your weight sink into the chair - just sit down until you feel contact between your body and the material of the seat. Now stand up again. Remember, no hands! Also, your feet should not move at all. Repeat for 10 reps per set, 3 sets.\n \nLunges - from a standing position, take a step forward with one foot. Drive your front knee forward and bend it, until your hip is as close to the heel of your front foot as you can manage, ideally with your rear leg being straight. Now move back up to your starting position and repeat the motion with the other leg. Repeat 10 times per set, for 3 sets.\n \nAs a beginner workout routine, that would usually be enough to start with."

If you can already do 3 x 20 or 3 x 25, do that instead. I am doing 3 x 50, trying to get to 4 x 50.\nBodyweight squats - I know, bodyweight for anything isn\u2019t as flashy as \u201cLiFtInG mAd WeIgHtS bRo\u201d but bodyweight squats, when done for high reps, will help strengthen and tone your quads which will then help when you actually perform squats with a higher weight. I personally do 3 x 40 for these but I\u2019d start at 3 x 20 or 3 x 25 for someone just starting.\nCalf Raises - These can be done with bodyweight, dumbbells, or the machine at the gym. All 3 work great and unless you\u2019re a neanderthal and don\u2019t stretch beforehand, you shouldn\u2019t get hurt doing these. These help with strengthening your calves (no shit) which will help with running for athletes and overall, aesthetically, I have had my calves commented on just as much as my upper body. I do 3 x 15 for these on the machine, but I load up the weight to 290 lbs. For bodyweight, I do around 3 x 30.\nBench Press - Bench press is probably the most common staple of any chest workout and for good reason. It not only helps with delivering a good pump to the pecs but it also seems to help with filling out the shoulders which for a lot of skinny guys working out is a huge plus. Dumbbells are great to start with as they teach balance and force you to use your pecs and not just your triceps and forearms to lift them. I do either 2 x 8 for this with 225 lbs or 3 x 12 with 165 pounds. I would start with a basic 3 x 10 with whatever weight you can do safely as a beginner.\nDeadlifts - Holy shit start light with this. People watch strongmen deadlift 1,000 pounds and they're like \u201cOh if they can do that then 300 is a breeze for me\u201d. THAT IS THE WRONG APPROACH TO ANY WORKOUT LET ALONE ONE THAT CAN REALLY FUCK YOU UP IF YOU DO IT WRONG! This strengthens your back, core, quads, and triceps among many other muscles when done right. I do this 3 x 5 with 405 pounds. I have been doing these for 5 years though and have built up to that. Start at 135 pounds and do high reps to get your form down. There is no shame in doing these, or frankly any workout, with a coach or trainer to get your form down. Safety is more important than \u201cMaD gAiNz BrO\u201d.\nThis is not a definitive list and I am not a medical doctor or professional trainer. This is how I was trained for lacrosse and it has worked pretty well for me functionally and aesthetically ever since. Granted there are other workouts like curls that I mostly do to have some \u201cflashy\u201d muscle but otherwise, my workout is based around cardio endurance, strength, and being able to react quickly (which is more of a stretching thing but that\u2019s a different topic for another time).\n \nFirst and foremost, workout to be healthy. Don\u2019t try to be a pro bodybuilder unless you understand what it takes. By that I mean, are you willing to do steroids? Are you willing to eat waaaayyyyyy too much protein than is healthy? Are you willing to give up hours upon hours of time chasing a fleeting feeling that will never satisfy you even if you are the best in the world? If you can answer all of those with yes honestly the fine, you know the risks and that\u2019s that.\n \n(BTW not knocking bodybuilders at all. Half of my lifting buddies are bodybuilders and they are some of the coolest people I know. It takes years of hard work, even with steroids, to get to that level. I can\u2019t do bodybuilding because of my health as I already have high Test levels and I really don\u2019t want to fuck with that. Also, my family is predisposed for heart complications and I have no desire to die at the age of 45 as my mom did from a heart attack).\n \nHope this helps,\n \nBen"

Superman Pose:\n \nIt is also called as Viparita Shalabhasana in yoga. This pose helps you strengthen shoulders, arms and glutes. It also improves your blood circulation and stamina.\n4. Padvritasana [Leg Circles]\n \nIf you are looking for losing some weight or shaping yourself, this is the asana that helps in reducing fats from your hips and thighs.\n \nIt's effortless to do it. You have to lie down on your back, and your arm should be resting alongside, so, in this, there are two ways of doing it:\n \nLift your right side make a circle ten or 15 times same goes with the left side.\n \nLift both of your legs and try to rotate them ten times in clock and anticlockwise direction.\n5. Jumping Jack:\n \nIt's a part of a cardio workout, and as a beginner, you should certainly try it because it increases your energy level, stamina burns your belly, tight fat. You don't need to do it for 20 or 30 mins; you can do 2 or 3 sets in a day.\nThese are the few home workouts you can try doing it.\n \nYes, we all understand, we are at home so it's natural to be stressed out and get irritated, for that you must try these home workouts which can keep your mind and body calm"

I also didn't have a solid workout plan, didn't know anything about planning correctly, eating, and sleeping accordingly. It was a waste of time. What I mean is that I failed miserably.\n \nEventually, after doing lots of research, I started a strength training plan that entails barbell deadlifts, squats, and bench, all multi-joint workouts. Pow!. It was a firework. I fell in love with the whole concept of barbell workouts. It is an athletic workout; it empowers, builds character, and produces unique physical sturdiness and athleticism beyond anything I experienced. Working with a coach, I learned different variants of these lifts and made progress safely. Two years later, I arrived. I gained everything I planned and then some. Thank You Strength Training! -hooray.\n \nSo, I advocate the same system to others, the ones that are courageous and adventurous and willing to achieve difficult things in life.\n \nIf you are an absolute beginner, you can start with a plan of daily walking and gradually adding sessions of strength training.\n \nThat's how I began my Powerlifting experience.\n \nResistance training is medicine: effects of strength training on health - PubMed\n \nDisclaimer:\n \nMansour\u2019s disclaimer:\n \nDon't do anything stupid and get hurt lifting big weights after reading some of my answers.

I opted to go with a push-pull-legs split - I figured I could at least get three days in. Ideally, it would have looked like this:\nBut a funny thing happened: if I had any kind of conflict at all, I skipped leg day. Board meeting runs late? Skip leg day. Get in an argument with my girlfriend? Skip leg day. Looks like rain outside? You get the idea. No excuse was too trivial.\n \nEventually, I realized that \u201cleg day\u201d - devoting an entire workout session to some of the most taxing exercises you can do - was psychologically overwhelming. So I moved to total body because it ensured that I worked legs and worked with my schedule. Yes, I still had to do squats and deadlifts, but 1) I didn\u2019t have to do them on the same day and 2) I got to follow them up with what I like to call \u201cdessert\u201d exercises - curls, triceps pushdowns, etc.\n \nHowever, just because total body works for me doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best option for you. You know your schedule better than I do. And, more importantly, you know yourself - your tendencies, your weak areas, etc. Take all of that knowledge into consideration and then choose the option that works best for you."

Regardless of the objective worth of the routine, make sure that:\nyou get something done, even if it\u2019s not perfect or it\u2019s not everything you planned\nyou have fun doing it (that way it\u2019s easier to stay consistent)\nyou stay safe while doing it (do the stuff you know, and ask for help for the stuff you don\u2019t know)\nyou leave something in the tank so you can come back tomorrow and do something (that way it\u2019s easier to stay consistent)\nyou STOP IMMEDIATELY if something seems off, such as pain, nausea, dizziness, breathlessness, etc. Always listen to your body. A certain degree of soreness in the muscles is inevitable when we move in ways that we\u2019re not used to, but it shouldn\u2019t be crippling (that means you\u2019ve overdone it). But any other kind of pain, especially in your joints, or any of the other things I mentioned, are red flags\nThat said, here are some more specific suggestions.\nMake sure your routine has a strength component. Do this 2\u20133 times a week, on non-consecutive days.\nMake sure your routine has an endurance component. Do this 3\u20135 times a week.\nMake sure you keep your joints mobile. Do this almost everyday; think of it like \u2018brushing your teeth\u2019, but for your joints.\nSTRENGTH\n \nFor each of the categories below, pick an exercise which is moderately challenging (not too hard and not too easy). Accumulate 15 - 30 total repetitions per session for each category. Split them up any way you like. If you feel like the exercise in a particular category goes from \u2018moderately challenging\u2019 to \u2018easy\u2019, pick a harder version of the exercise, go back down to the lower end of that repetition range, and build your way up to the higher end. Then rinse and repeat. Be patient and do this over months, not days. That\u2019s how you stay safe. Sometimes, to make an exercise harder, you\u2019ll need to add more weight. Be creative and use household objects.\nPushing (push up variations)\nPulling (dead hang, pull up variations, rowing variations)\nSquatting (squat/lunge etc)\nENDURANCE\n \nPick an activity you enjoy (e.g. walking/hiking/running/swimming/cycling/dancing etc) - it doesn\u2019t matter what you pick. You can switch it up session to session, or not, as you like - it doesn\u2019t matter. Do it steadily for 20\u201330 minutes. Do it at a difficulty level where you can speak 5\u20136 words at a time before needing to take a breath (but if you can speak 15\u201320 words, you need to step it up).\n \nOnce you\u2019re used to the activity, increase the duration of one session a week to 45 minutes, while the other sessions remain 20\u201330 minutes. Eventually increase the long session close to 60 minutes.\n \nJOINT MOBILITY\n \nLook at every joint in your body - neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, spine, hips, knees and ankles. Each of them can move in certain ways. Some joints, such as the neck, spine, hips, and shoulders, can move more freely than the others. Throughout the day, take little breaks of a minute or two, and keep moving the joints in all the ways they CAN move. Keep it super easy, but do it a bunch of times. Don\u2019t sweat if you can\u2019t move EVERY joint EVERY day, just make sure no joint gets ignored for too long. Easy-peasy.\n \nHope you find this helpful. It looks simple, but the power is in DOING, not in KNOWING. If you\u2019re a beginner and you keep this up for a few months, your health, energy, and overall sense of well-being are bound to improve. Good luck!"

Telling them to workout 6 times per week, eat 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and other useless nonsense. Sure that works for the guys taking steroids, but all it does for a natural trainer is lead them nowhere. Yeah, you might experience results in a few months, but after that you\u2019ll stagnate.\n \nFull-body workouts on the other hand, are the perfect routines for natural trainers. They offer enough volume, but not too much to where you can\u2019t recover from. In addition, you\u2019re joints and central nervous system get more of a break and time to recover because you\u2019re not training as often.\n \nAll you need in a full-body workout is a major push, a major pull, and a major legs exercise. The intermediate and advance could also benefit from some assistance exercises for the arms and calves. But other than that, this is all you will ever need to grow. I currently am 6\u20321 and weigh 203 lbs, at 11 percent body fat. And I have been on a maintenance routine only lifting weights twice per week and sprinting on a third day. I haven\u2019t gained any mass (hence the maintenance routine) but I still have continued to gain strength. One of my example workouts was this:\n \nWeighted Dips: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nWeighted Chin-ups: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nSquats: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nCalf raises and forearms: 2\u20133 sets of 10\u201315 reps\n \nWill you get to be 250 at 5 % body fat and become some absolute beast?? Hell no, not even close. But no natural trainer will ever get that close. If you are around 6 feet tall, the most you can ever expect to weight at 10 percent body fat is probably 215 to 220. And those numbers are for someone with very great genetics.\n \nI love how people think they need to follow the split routines 6 days per week because everyone else is doing it.\n \nWell, how many people do you see that are big and strong? Not many. How many people do you see at the gym following those splits who are actually big and NOT taking steroids? Probably zero.\n \nI talk about this in great detail in my book which you can find here: \nBasic But Brutal"

They work most of the primary muscle groups and will give you a good base strength.\n \nHere is an article that goes more in-depth :)\n \nhttps://www.t-nation.com/training/plp-the-60-day-challenge"

Examples of home workouts include bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, lunges, and planks, as well as cardio activities like jumping jacks, burpees, and jump rope. Incorporate resistance bands or dumbbells for added intensity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week and gradually increase intensity as you progress.

Here's a well-rounded workout routine for beginners:\n \nWarm-up (5-10 minutes):\n \nStart with a light cardiovascular activity like brisk walking, jogging, or cycling to increase blood flow and warm up your muscles. Follow it with some dynamic stretches to improve flexibility and mobility.\n \nStrength Training (2-3 times a week):\n \nFocus on full-body workouts that target major muscle groups. Here's a sample routine:\n \nSquats:\n 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions\n \nPush-ups (can be modified): 2 sets of 8-10 repetitions\n \nDumbbell lunges: 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions per leg\n \nDumbbell shoulder press: 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions\n \nBent-over dumbbell rows: 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions\n \nPlanks:\n 2 sets, holding for 30-60 seconds each\n \nStart with lighter weights and progress gradually as you get comfortable with the exercises.\n \nCardiovascular Exercise (3-4 times a week):\n \nChoose activities you enjoy, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, or dancing. Aim for 20-30 minutes per session, gradually increasing the duration as your fitness level improves.\n \nFlexibility and Cool Down (5-10 minutes):\n \nStretch your major muscle groups, holding each stretch for 15-30 seconds. This will improve flexibility and help prevent injury. Focus on areas like hamstrings, quadriceps, chest, shoulders, and calves.\n \nRest and Recovery:\n \nAllow your body to rest and recover between workouts. Beginners should aim for at least one or two days of rest per week. Listen to your body and adjust the intensity or frequency of workouts if needed.\n \nHydration and Nutrition:\n \nStay hydrated throughout your workouts and ensure you're fueling your body with a balanced diet that includes a good mix of proteins, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables.\n \nRemember, consistency is key. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts as your fitness improves. If you have any health concerns or medical conditions, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise routine."

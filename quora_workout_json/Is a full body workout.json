But that is for people with especially good recovery abilities.\n \nIt amazes me how much the bodybuilding industry has confused the shit out of people. Telling them to workout 6 times per week, eat 2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, and other useless nonsense. Sure that works for the guys taking steroids, but all it does for a natural trainer is lead them nowhere. Yeah, you might experience results in a few months, but after that you\u2019ll stagnate.\n \nFull-body workouts on the other hand, are the perfect routines for natural trainers. They offer enough volume, but not too much to where you can\u2019t recover from. In addition, you\u2019re joints and central nervous system get more of a break and time to recover because you\u2019re not training as often.\n \nAll you need in a full-body workout is a major push, a major pull, and a major legs exercise. The intermediate and advance could also benefit from some assistance exercises for the arms and calves. But other than that, this is all you will ever need to grow. I currently am 6\u20321 and weigh 203 lbs, at 11 percent body fat. And I have been on a maintenance routine only lifting weights twice per week and sprinting on a third day. I haven\u2019t gained any mass (hence the maintenance routine) but I still have continued to gain strength. One of my example workouts was this:\n \nWeighted Dips: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nWeighted Chin-ups: Work up to max set of 5 reps\n \nSquats: Work up to max set..."

I use a loaded barbell in my garage and or my driveway\n \n. All you need is a squat rack, bumpers and few barbells. Doing olympic lifts ( above ) demands \nskills, \nbut staying with the \nbig 3 exercises \nis very adequate to build a similar physique.\n \nIf you use compound exercise with proper programming of volume, intensity, breaks, sets, reps and if combined with suitable nutrition and recovery, you will reach your goal.\n \nPS:\n I am not a personal trainer.

Studies consistently show that full body routines cause better fat loss, often double or more of that of a split routine. (see chart below, -5.7% fat loss for full body, vs -2.1% for split group)\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885621/\nTriple the fat loss and triple the muscle growth? Sign me up!\nMore frequent \npractice \nwith the movements-that could explain why the bench results were very similar above (simple movement) but the full body group got better squat gains (more complex movement). They just had more \npractice\n.\nSorry\u2026I just love that video.\n \nFull body routine disadvantages\nThey\u2019re \nhard\n. This is BY FAR the main reason people gravitate towards bro splits. Mentally, going into the gym and working your entire body just is on another plane of existence in terms of difficulty compared to just working one chunk of muscle, even if the volume is the same. It\u2019s easy to tap out when you have to do front squats, RDLs, bench press, overhead press, seated rows, pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, extensions and ab wheel all in the same day.\nPerhaps because of this, they can be tough on your \nhormone levels\n. Check the above chart; the full body testosterone went up 11%, but the split went up 21%! Keep in mind this was just four weeks, working out just three times per week, as well. Keeping up a full body protocol all the time, for higher volumes could \nprobably \nlead to reductions in T for some people.\nThey give you \nless time \nto \nrecover\n. This is part of the reason that I really am sure to use a lot of variety in my training when incorporating higher frequency. If you use the same movements all the time, be prepared for your joints to be unhappy. You need to vary the movement patterns enough that it shifts the stress on the joints at least slightly.\nSplit routine advantages\nMore \nrecovery time \nfor each body part between workouts.\nMight have better satellite cell activation (check the answer below) due to the \nincreased concentrated workload \nand greater \nmuscle damage\n. \nGeoffrey Verity Schofield's answer to How fast does lost muscle grow back with muscle memory?\nGet a \nbetter pump\n-doing more work in one session can lead to greater metabolic stress for that muscle.\nCan help you develop a better \nmind-muscle connection. \nYes, that\u2019s a real thing, especially for the upper body.\nCauses increased \nsoreness\n, which can facilitate growth and let you \u201cfeel\u201d that muscle better. This could be a disadvantage if you don\u2019t like this feeling\u2026I personally kinda like it for some twisted reason.\nSplit routine disadvantages\nLower frequency \nper muscle group. This is probably the biggest reason why split routines suck. You do chest on Monday (obviously), and your chest is really only growing for about 36\u201348hours afterwards. There are 168 hours of the week-why would you only have each muscle group growing 20\u201330% of the time? \nNot optimal! \nFull body routines can get that number up to 70\u201380+% for the entire body, which explains the massive difference in both muscle gain and fat loss.\nYou \ncan \nactually \nLOSE muscle\n. In the above example, you\u2019re growing on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. You might be maintaining on Thursday and Friday. But especially if you are cutting or not getting in enough protein, or not sleeping well, it\u2019s entirely possible for the weekend to be in a catabolic state.\nNot that kind of Weaknd; he\u2019s in a catabolic state 24/7\nYou can \nlose \u201ctouch\u201d \nwith an exercise. This isn\u2019t gonna happen with bicep curls or lateral raises, but with something like squatting or Olympic lifting, it\u2019s entirely possible for the nervous system to slightly forget how to do these movements if you\u2019re only doing them once per week.\nAll in all, I\u2019d do full body \nmost \nof the time, but if you hit a plateau, splitting up your routine can be a nice change of pace.\n \nYou\u2019ll have more time to recover, and can really focus on blasting a body part to force it to grow, perhaps through the aforementioned satellite cells. You can recover any hormonal or structural stress incurred during your full body bonanza.\n \nI\u2019ve taken a page out of Eric Helm\u2019s book\nand been doing full body workouts 4\u20136 times a week recently, and it\u2019s been astonishingly effective. Tough\u2026but the gains have been impressive.\n \nBut, I won\u2019t do it for the rest of my life, as it\u2019s not sustainable.\n \nCheck out my new \nSpace\n, \nfollow me on \nInstagram\n \nfor daily diet and training tips!

This maximizes efficiency.\nHigh-Intensity Training:\n Incorporate techniques like supersets, circuit training, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to increase the intensity and calorie burn within a shorter time frame.\nProgressive Overload:\n Ensure you are gradually increasing the weight or resistance in your workouts to continue making progress.\nConsistency:\n Stick to a regular workout schedule, whether it\u2019s full-body or split, to maintain progress.\nNutrition and Recovery:\n Pay attention to your diet and recovery strategies, as they are crucial for maximizing results. Ensure adequate protein intake and consider active recovery strategies.\nListen to Your Body:\n Adjust your training volume and intensity based on how your body responds to avoid burnout or injury.\nConclusion\n \nBoth full-body workouts and split routines can be effective, but for minimal time investment, full-body workouts (2-3 times a week) are generally more efficient for most people. However, if you prefer or can commit to a split routine and it fits your goals better, it can also yield excellent results. Ultimately, choose the method that you enjoy and can stick with consistently."

I feel the mind-muscle connection can be established in a bro-split routine better than a full body, strength focused routine.\n \nIn my opinion, there are just way too many variables in a bro-split routine to manage, track, and progress. It also requires way too training days to be effective. I would always recommend a well structured, well periodized full body routine to a beginner-intermediate lifter who seeks strength and muscle gains. It usually takes 3\u20134 training days a week to make excellent progress.\n \nIf you don\u2019t mind spending some money, I would recommend \nBarbell Medicine\n; they have excellent training templates for pretty much any goals that you have. If you\u2019re looking for free resources, you can check out \nBrian Alsruhe\u2019s\n YouTube channel; he has good guidelines to create your own program. If you\u2019re an absolute beginner, you can go for \nStarting Strength Linear Progression\n or \nStrongLifts 5x5\n.\n@PallavPanda"

Working each muscle group 3 times a week is adequate to properly train your body. However, the one downside to this plan is that you may be fatigued at the end of your full body workouts and the muscle groups you work last may start to fall behind. To combat this, be sure to mix up which groups you work first at the gym!"

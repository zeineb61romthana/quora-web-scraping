The cons are- it takes a lot of time to complete the session. Also training this longer leads to central nervous system fatigue, which affects the intensity of training and intensity is one of the major contributors to hypertrophy. Also training muscle groups like triceps with the same intensity after doing bench press is difficult because intensity is compromised due to the onset of peripheral fatigue at this point. So, my advice to you- follow full body workouts only in cases you want to build foundational strength as in beginners. A full body workout for an intermediate is inferior in terms of hypertrophy."

At least 5. There has to be a warmup for each exercise which means a lot of time spent doing warm-up sets. Advanced athletes will also need to include many isolation exercises.\n \n3: Even after warm-up, it takes at least 2 sets to get a grasp of the technique and make the most out of an exercise. A higher frequency training means a lower number of sets per session which won\u2019t allow performing more than 2\u20133 sets for an exercise. This is why advanced athletes train with a lower frequency, less number of exercises, and a higher number of sets per session. Less warmup and more exercise.\n \n4: Too much fatigue will accumulate due to training every single day. This might not be a concern for beginners but it will affect advanced athletes. It's better to train full body 3\u20136 times per week and adjust rest days accordingly.\n \nFull-body workouts are undoubtedly effective but doing them every single day is not.\n \nSubscribe to \nBrawny King Fitness\n for legit fitness videos."

Usually, you would be working with a decent coach.\nIf you are Oly lifting, all movements are compound and multi-joints. You can train every day as long as you don't go heavy every time you touch the bar. In the past, I have trained Oly lifting at a high weekly frequency when learning to Snatch and Clean. I visited the Weightlifting Club thrice-weekly, working with a coach, and I trained another two weekly sessions solo to keep up with the homework. That's five days of weekly training.

For example, the starting strength workout routine has you squat for 3 sets, bench press or overhead press for 3 sets and then deadlift for 1 set.\n \nThis approach really helps you get good at the compound exercises.\n \nCons,\n \nIf you want to target a specific body part from many different angles with different exercises a full-body workout will make it harder to do this.\n \nAnd you\u2019d probably be better off with a more traditional bodybuilding split."

Second of all you won\u2019t necessarily be able to focus on specific muscle groups like for example a push, pull, legs split offers training chest, triceps, and shoulders for a push day. Back and biceps for pull day. And of course legs for legs. It allows your body to recover while training other body parts you can do this split 3 days a week or 6 with a rest on Sunday."

They allow you to get into neutral grips more easily (which also tend to be nicer on the shoulders).\nThey allow you to train rotational patterns with greater ease (there are landmine exercises you can do with a barbell that are rotational, and you can off-set the loads of barbell to make them more rotationally demanding though)\nBodyweight on it's own often isn't enough because it's a fixed load, once you've adapted to the load you can only do more repetitions (i.e. you can increase endurance but not really strength at that point). Dumbbells will allow you to train closed and open chain movements too.\nDumbbells often let you train with a more natural arc/position\nCons:\n \nBarbells let you lift more (which is more important for lower rep, higher intensity lifting) - especially for the major bilateral lifts (you will generally always be able to bench press, squat and deadlift more with a barbell than dumbbells)\nBarbells are less grip intensive. Dumbbells require more grip strength (which isn't necessarily a bad thing - it just creates a limiting factor if you want to train strength/power more completely)\nBarbells generally allow for better mechanical loading changes with lower body training. i.e. the difference between a back squat (try putting some DB's on your shoulders to see what I mean), a front squat, an overhead squat, and a zercher squat all lead to good training outcomes when used with some variety.\nBarbells allow you to alter grip positions differently by leveraging torque (narrow grip bench vs medium grip or wide grip - can yield different training results you won't be able to get with dumbbells).\nKettlebells provide a better grip challenge than dumbbells and are more suited for exercises like the swing\nKettlebells provide a higher proprioceptive stimulus, particularly for explosive lifts\nBands provide a unique stimulus that is generally hardest where people are their strongest (Dumbbells like Barbells are a more fixed weight relative to the human strength curve)\nSleds allow you to more adequately train concentric only patterns, which can be great for not making you too sore between more dynamic lift days and still getting a training effect.\nI could probably go on. At the end of the day I think having access to a variety of stimulus is ideal, however, you can still get a lot done with dumbbells and bodyweight if that's your only existing option."

I train with something called Texas Method where I alternate heavy weight days with hypertrophy (8\u201312 reps) days. A joint supplement is helpful to ward off some of the inflammation that comes naturally with weight lifting"

I opted to go with a push-pull-legs split - I figured I could at least get three days in. Ideally, it would have looked like this:\nBut a funny thing happened: if I had any kind of conflict at all, I skipped leg day. Board meeting runs late? Skip leg day. Get in an argument with my girlfriend? Skip leg day. Looks like rain outside? You get the idea. No excuse was too trivial.\n \nEventually, I realized that \u201cleg day\u201d - devoting an entire workout session to some of the most taxing exercises you can do - was psychologically overwhelming. So I moved to total body because it ensured that I worked legs and worked with my schedule.

Sign me up!\nMore frequent \npractice \nwith the movements-that could explain why the bench results were very similar above (simple movement) but the full body group got better squat gains (more complex movement). They just had more \npractice\n.\nSorry\u2026I just love that video.\n \nFull body routine disadvantages\nThey\u2019re \nhard\n. This is BY FAR the main reason people gravitate towards bro splits. Mentally, going into the gym and working your entire body just is on another plane of existence in terms of difficulty compared to just working one chunk of muscle, even if the volume is the same. It\u2019s easy to tap out when you have to do front squats, RDLs, bench press, overhead press, seated rows, pulldowns, lateral raises, curls, extensions and ab wheel all in the same day.\nPerhaps because of this, they can be tough on your \nhormone levels\n. Check the above chart; the full body testosterone went up 11%, but the split went up 21%! Keep in mind this was just four weeks, working out just three times per week, as well. Keeping up a full body protocol all the time, for higher volumes could \nprobably \nlead to reductions in T for some people.\nThey give you \nless time \nto \nrecover\n. This is part of the reason that I really am sure to use a lot of variety in my training when incorporating higher frequency. If you use the same movements all the time, be prepared for your joints to be unhappy. You need to vary the movement patterns enough that it shifts the stress on the joints at least slightly.\nSplit routine advantages\nMore \nrecovery time \nfor each body part between workouts.\nMight have better satellite cell activation (check the answer below) due to the \nincreased concentrated workload \nand greater \nmuscle damage\n. \nGeoffrey Verity Schofield's answer to How fast does lost muscle grow back with muscle memory?\nGet a \nbetter pump\n-doing more work in one session can lead to greater metabolic stress for that muscle.\nCan help you develop a better \nmind-muscle connection. \nYes, that\u2019s a real thing, especially for the upper body.\nCauses increased \nsoreness\n, which can facilitate growth and let you \u201cfeel\u201d that muscle better. This could be a disadvantage if you don\u2019t like this feeling\u2026I personally kinda like it for some twisted reason.\nSplit routine disadvantages\nLower frequency \nper muscle group. This is probably the biggest reason why split routines suck. You do chest on Monday (obviously), and your chest is really only growing for about 36\u201348hours afterwards. There are 168 hours of the week-why would you only have each muscle group growing 20\u201330% of the time? \nNot optimal! \nFull body routines can get that number up to 70\u201380+% for the entire body, which explains the massive difference in both muscle gain and fat loss.\nYou \ncan \nactually \nLOSE muscle\n. In the above example, you\u2019re growing on Monday, Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. You might be maintaining on Thursday and Friday. But especially if you are cutting or not getting in enough protein, or not sleeping well, it\u2019s entirely possible for the weekend to be in a catabolic state.\nNot that kind of Weaknd; he\u2019s in a catabolic state 24/7\nYou can \nlose \u201ctouch\u201d \nwith an exercise. This isn\u2019t gonna happen with bicep curls or lateral raises, but with something like squatting or Olympic lifting, it\u2019s entirely possible for the nervous system to slightly forget how to do these movements if you\u2019re only doing them once per week.\nAll in all, I\u2019d do full body \nmost \nof the time, but if you hit a plateau, splitting up your routine can be a nice change of pace.\n \nYou\u2019ll have more time to recover, and can really focus on blasting a body part to force it to grow, perhaps through the aforementioned satellite cells. You can recover any hormonal or structural stress incurred during your full body bonanza.\n \nI\u2019ve taken a page out of Eric Helm\u2019s book\nand been doing full body workouts 4\u20136 times a week recently, and it\u2019s been astonishingly effective.

You would feel so lazy to skip the gym and put those clothes back in the drawer, so you get up, grab your gym bag, pour a much needed coffee, and head out the door.\n \nThe ride to the gym is peaceful. The world is still asleep, the sun is still down, and you own the road.\n \nYou walk in the gym, a little more energized but still stiff. You\u2019re already here so you might as well get started with some warmups.\n \nThe gym is practically empty and all the equipment is available. You pick your first exercise and begin.\n \nBefore you know it, the initial sleepiness has drifted away and been replaced with a fresh dose of energy.\n \nYou get in the zone, start sweating, and feel your heart pounding as you crush your workout.\n \nForty-five minutes later and you are done. You shower and step out of the gym heading for your car. You remember that the rest of the world is just waking up.\nThe sun is peaking out, the birds are stretching their wings, and the air is filled with slightly more activity than when you first got there.\n \nYou drive to work feeling energized, knowing that you\u2019ve already conquered the day and improved yourself. Regardless of how the rest of the day goes, you know deep down that you already won.\n \nTo top if off, your mind is ready to get to work and you feel free knowing that your evening is completely open.\n \nThis, is the feeling of working out in the morning.\n \nEVENING WORKOUT\n \nThe evening workout has a completely different vibe.\n \nYou wake up at a normal time and head to work with everyone else.\n \nAs the work day starts winding down, you begin thinking about your workout.\n \nIf you\u2019ve eaten healthy during the day, you\u2019re energized and ready to get in there and crush it.\n \nIf you haven\u2019t eaten healthy, you feel sleepiness slowly creeping in.\n \nEither way, you snag a coffee and leave, happy that the work day is over.\n \nAs you sip on your coffee, and listen to your pre-gym music in your car, you start feeling more excited about the gym.\n \nYou\u2019re either happy to be able to leave the stress of work behind you or eager to get to the weights and lift the stress away.\n \nUnlike the morning, you get to the gym and your body and mind are already awake. However, the gym is more crowded at this time of day and you have to strategically pick which exercise to start with.\n \nYou put your headphones in, find an empty machine, and get to work.\n \nThe right song comes on, you start sweating, and you feel your heart pounding as you crush your workout.\n \nAn hour and fifteen minutes later (due to some waiting for machines) you finish up and head for the door. You step out of the gym and head for your car, realizing that the sun is starting to lower on the horizon.\nYou head home feeling pumped that you conquered the day and improved yourself. The day is almost over, but you still have a couple hours to eat, shower, and do whatever you please.\n \nThis, is the feeling of working out in the evening.\nWhich is better?\n \nI can\u2019t make that decision for you.\n \nTest them both out and see what fits your lifestyle.\n \nAt the end of the day, the best time to work out is the one that you actually stick to."

This forces the body to adapt. It doesn't adapt much to a stimulus that is easy for it to accomplish.\n \nBut...introduce some lighter weeks every 4-12 weeks, these tend to work themselves in quite naturally in my experience with busy folks as you go on vacation or get caught up in other things every now and then. However, the more experienced you get with training the more deliberately you should probably plan what we call de-loads.\n \nA few deloads within the year:\n \nAllows the body some recovery time to adapt to a repetitive stimulus given to it over a period of weeks or even months\nPrevents overdoing it \nGives you a bit of a mental break\nThat being said it's probably not really crucial for people just starting in with exercise as you won't be able to work at really high levels of intensity until you've been training for a little while (probably 3-6 months at a minimum).\n \nTraining should get progressively harder over time because your ability will get progressively better over time, but it should also be cyclical. You progress as much as you can over a period of time \n(usually about 4 weeks for most folks and to keep things relatively simple) \nthen back off a little and let nature do it's thing -- \ncompensate for all the training.\n \nWeight loss requires inefficient workouts, so you need to track your efficiency and improvement. If you're fast, then maybe distance based training is more inefficient. If you're good with distance than maybe speed based training is more inefficient. You want to cycle to more inefficient methods that your body isn't as comfortable with roughly every 4 or so weeks to keep your body adapting.\n \n30 minutes of walk/run is a good place to start but your body will quickly become adapted to that stimulus if it stays the same for too long. \n \nSo assuming you're only using this method, here are some ideas on what to track so you're progressively overloading your 30 minute walk/run:\n \nSpeed\nHeart Rate\nDistance\nRest\nSpeed\n \nIf you're running at 6mph and walking at 3mph then obviously bumping up your speeds means you're improving. Try to add 0.1 mph each time you go in to one or the other. This is assuming you're using something like a treadmill but you could do the same outside with a GPS tracker. \n \nThe faster you run the less length of time you'll be able to maintain that speed so faster intervals often require more rest and burn a little more. They are also generally more effective in my experience for fat loss, but periodic improvement, change and variety trumps high intensity interval training still.\n \nObviously the faster you go the more rest you need, but you might not want to start sprinting right away, work up to it over the first few months. \n \nHeart Rate\n \nRequires a heart rate monitor, I'd recommend a chest strap as they are the most accurate and will work with pretty much any kind of equipment at the gym. If you can work at a greater speed with a lower heart rate, then your cardiovascular fitness is improving, if you start to notice that improvement taper off over time (like after 4 weeks of training) then it's a good idea to switch what you're doing or switch what you're measuring.\n \nAnother thing you can watch for is what we call Heart Rate Recovery, or how quickly your heart rate comes back down after you run back to a walk. The faster this is, the more cardiovascularly fit you are and I'd argue this is more important in the grand scheme of things than heart rate alone. If the speed of your recovery tapers off, again you need a change and/or you should consider shortening your rest interval of your walk-run, or increasing the speed of one or the other.\n \nDistance\n \nIf you cover more distance with the same walk run protocol in the same time frame, obviously you improved speed. Covering more distance in the same time frame is an indication you are getting more fit, if this tapers off, again another indication that something needs to change. You could also simply make your objective to cover more distance and not worry about tracking speed. The difference of this metric is really just where your focus lies.\n \nRest\n \nLess walking while keeping your running at the same intensity is obviously harder. So you could choose to monitor this and rather than altering the above, just knock 5 seconds off your rest intervals each workout until you can't keep up to your previous work interval \n(an indication you've tapered off and need a change)\n. So you do 6 mph run for 2 minutes, 3 mph walk for 1 minute, then do 55 seconds, 50 seconds, 45 seconds, 40 seconds, 35 seconds, etc....keep the work interval the same if you use this method.\n \nPick one variable to monitor and change either every 4 weeks or when you notice that you're not improving that variable. Don't change a bunch of variables at once. For instance, if you are doing 2 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking, try to bump up your speed to as much as you can handle over a 4 week period, but don't also change the duration of the interval. Next 4 weeks, change the duration of the interval but try to keep the speed consistently as high as you can. Give yourself constraints for improvement and roll with one change at a time for simplicity sake. This also gives you a lot more opportunity for variety every 4 weeks, rather than changing too much at once.\n \nI'd say if 3 workouts in a row are far too similar in progress \n(i.e. you can't get a little bit faster, or take less rest, or run longer than you did 3-4 workouts before)\n then you need to change something, generally if you have enough variety in what you're tracking.\n \nThat's the general principle behind training.\n \nHowever, for fat loss, I'd highly recommend learning how to do some resistance training and add that into your routine every other day \n(conditioning work one day for 30 minutes, resistance training the next for 30 minutes) \nespecially full-body compound movements like squats, deadlifts, presses, pulls, etc...\n \nSee additionally, my answers to:\n \nWhat are the best ways to reduce and eliminate belly, abdominal, and thigh fat?\nHow do you customize a weight loss and exercise plan for yourself?\nWhat should everyone know about strength training and weightlifting?\nWhat is a realistic plan for losing 20% of my body weight? I\u2019m a 52 year old male, 6'2\u2033, 270.1 lbs.\n \nWhat is the best way to lose fat while minimizing muscle loss?"

A guide would be  2-3 minutes for the first movement and all compound movements, 1-2 for the second movement, and then 1-1:30 for the rest of the movements.\n \nThe rest can change sometimes, there will be times where you want to keep the rest very limited and then there will be times when you want to rest a little extra.

They do not have as much testosterone, but actually secrete higher growth hormone than men. Growth hormone will allow you to build a tighter/leaner physique. \n \nSince diet is 80% of any fitness goal, I'd stick to lean protein + veggies 5 times a day. Drink plenty of water in between meals. Have a refeed, carb heavy meal for one of your meals every 4th or 5th day. This will keep your fat burning hormones charged. And remember, it's not about finding time, but making time. The president trains 45 mins a day 6 times a week, and he's the busiest man alive.

There are simply degrees of effectiveness based on your goals, training age, training history, genetics, etc. \n \nIf you want to get strong, functional strength an upper body and lower body split is a great way to go. \nI prefer to use primarily free weights (barbells and dumbbells, and bodyweight), which tend to recruit a higher percentage of muscle fibers\nYour idea rep range will depend on your goals. Check out Prilepin tables for a rough guide:\nYour rest periods will depend on your training. The heavier you're lifting, the longer rest you need between sets. If you're training in the 1-5 rep range, you may need 4-5 minutes rest between sets. This will decrease as you move to lower rep ranges. If you're training with 9-12 reps, you may only need 30-60 seconds of rest between sets. (Keep in mind this is just a rough guideline)@\nPush yourself to technical failure (not absolute failure). Meaning: once your form stars to deteriorate, you should stop within 1-2 reps. Remember: your body ALWAYS adapts to EXACTLY what you do and continuing to train after technical failure will engrain bad movement patterns. \nDefinitely listen to music! Anything that helps get you in the right head space and contributes to a positive training experience is a huge bonus. Music has powerful psychological effects and it is smart to harness these in training. \nSome recommended books that helped me early in my journey:\nStarting Strength by Mark Rippetoe\n5/3/1 by Jim Wendler\nStretching Scientifically by Thomas Kurz\nHow to Eat, Move, and Be Healthy by Paul Chek"

You may not lose all of the 30 lbs but in the process you will build some muscle (not to be confused with getting huge/bulky).

This means that in order to build strength, \nyou\u2019ll want to lift heavier weights for shorter durations\n, rather than lighter weights for longer durations.\n \nNow, there are many different (often conflicting) schools of thought on how to optimally stimulate the body so as to build strength, so I don\u2019t want to offer anything as the be-all, end-all of strength building, but \nhere\u2019s a general structure that should at least get you started\n:\n \n-Compound exercises (exercises that involve more than one joint such as leg press, chest press, compound row, etc.) will be the most effective and efficient exercises. You can do isolation exercises as well (like bicep curls, etc.), but I would suggest you start your workouts with the compounds for optimal results.\n \n-For a given exercise, find a weight that will completely fatigue your muscles in about 1\u20132 minutes. Anything you cannot do for at least a minute is probably too heavy, and anything over two minutes is probably too light to stimulate the best results (as far as strength is concerned).\n \n-Try not to let your muscles relax for the entire duration of each exercise. So for example, if you\u2019re using a leg press machine, don\u2019t lock your legs out, and don\u2019t rest the weights at the bottom. Keep moving and keep the muscles working the whole time. (This is important! Resting during an exercise allows your slow-twitch (endurance) muscle fibers a chance to recover, limiting engagement from fast-twitch (strength) fibers and therefore limiting your improvements in strength.)\n \n-Perform as many repetitions as you can, \nslowly\n*,\n until you can no longer \nsafely\n** \ncontinue (ie. muscle failure).\n \n*Emphasis on moving \nslowly\n because moving quickly means you are using momentum to carry the weight up/forward, and using gravity to assist on the way back. \nGo slowly and embrace the burn.\n \n**Emphasis on \nsafely\n because people tend to sacrifice form after getting carried away with thinking that the goal of exercising is to do as many repetitions as possible. It\u2019s not. The goal of exercise is to stimulate a response in the body. \nKeep good form\n, challenge yourself, and when you can no longer move the weight with good form, stop and slowly set the weight down.\n \n-One \ngood\n set (ie., total muscle failure) per exercise \nshould\n be sufficient. This might be a controversial take, but this is how I exercise, and it saves me a lot of pain and time, and limiting myself to one set doesn\u2019t seem to effect my results (as far as strength is concerned). Your results may vary, however, especially early on when you\u2019re learning to push yourself, so if you want to do multiple sets, knock yourself out.\n \nTL;DR\n: Lift and lower the weights slowly, with good form, without resting, until your muscles become completely fatigued and you can no longer complete your final repetition, which ideally would occur between 1\u20132 minutes.\n \nI hope this helps; good luck!"

And when performing each exercise, you must crush it. Work all the way to muscle failure. You can be done in 30 minutes."

Warmup your muscles before you start lifting heavy, create a mind-muscle connection and then start your actual workout.\nAfter workout-\nPost-Workout meal\n- If there was a pre workout meal, then there has to be a post workout meal. Why? Because you just hammered those muscles, your body is depleted of energy and that\u2019s why this meal is the most important meal of the day. \nYes, the most important meal of the day. \nI see folks in my gym who smoke cigarettes and consume a packet of chips after lifting weights. Please, don\u2019t do that.\nWater\n - Water is your body's principal chemical component and makes up about 60 percent of your body weight. It\u2019s important to stay hydrated through out the day, I drink a liter before my workout then a liter during my workout and then a liter after my workout. If you\u2019re drinking enough water then your body will stop holding on to it. Hence, weight loss.\nSleep - \nWe sleep in cycles.\n \nAnd our body recovers during deep sleep.\n \nSo, longer sleep results in longer deep sleep and longer deep sleep results in better recovery.\n \nNO RECOVERY = NO GAINS\nSupplements\n - I believe it\u2019s really hard to get all necessary nutrients from our regular diets, some people can do that, I agree, but not me. And there are so many of them, choose a supplement according to your goals. I\u2019m currently taking Omega 3, Multi-vitamins and Creatine Monohydrate.\nLet The Gains Begin!"

Plan your week such that you have a rest day in your weekly training split.\n \nWhen you are trying to \ngrow Lean Muscle Mass\n,\n the rest timing becomes very crucial, because it is in the rest and recovery that you actually grow(along with a good nutrition plan of course). Thus for such a goal \n3\u20135 days split\n ,with 4th and 6th day as rest is ideal.\n \nIf you are someone who is \ntrying to shed fat\n, then \n5\u20136 days \nwith mix of Strength and Cardiovascular training split would be ideal. Where 5th day can be your rest day.\n \nNow, someone like a bodybuilder would usually train a min \n5 times\n in a week during his/her offseason, and in prep season , it gradually increases up to \n14 times a week, \nwhere\n 14 times \nusually comprises\n of 2 sessions per day, one in the morning and one in the eve. \nAnd that even will be done around last month before competition. 3\u20134 days before competition i drops, and reduces to only 2\u20133 sessions of light full body circuit training just to sharpen the conditioning.\nMyself\nThen there are even more seasoned athletes like \nOlympic lifters\n, who train and practice almost all the 3 main Olympic lifts along with accessory workouts to improve their execution \n6 times a week\n. Their routines are so complex and dynamic that they have to train and practice everyday and sometimes twice a day. And they usually have one single day of complete rest in a week.\nIndia Olympic Lifter \nMirabai Chanu\nSomeone like a \nmarathon\n runner might practice running \n3 to 5 times\n a week to work upon their endurance stamina and improve their mileage over time.\nAnd also the training frequency for you to reach your fitness \nGOAL\n will depend upon :\nYour timeline to accomplish goal.

I\u2019m looking to get up to a three plate squat, 250 bench, and double body weight deadlift. Also general strength helps in daily life. Pull ups, RDLs, and overhead press are accessory movements to assist with bench and deadlift. Cable rows are to keep my bad shoulder from acting up. Curls are because, to quote Megan Gallagher, \u201cBiceps make me feel pretty.\u201d Ab work is because I get tested on sit-ups.

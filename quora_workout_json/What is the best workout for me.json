If you want the quality of The Rock or Matt Bomer's washboard abdominal muscles, or the speed or agility of Usain Bolt or Cam Newton, you have to work. If your goals are not so lofty (you want to feel good, maybe lose a few pounds, or just keep your place), then you still have to figure out how the fitness class will fit your life. Don't worry, through these strategies, no matter what kind of fitness \"guy\" you are, we can cover everyone.\nFor the guy who has no free time\n \nWe see, you are very busy, and sometimes the gym falls at the bottom of the to-do list. Sorry to say that if you are serious about health and wellness, it will not happen. When you seem to have spoken all the hours of the day, you must find ways to increase efficiency. For example, bring lunch so you can spend half of your rest time on exercise and the other half on eating. Or consider becoming an early riser so that you can exercise before life happens, and then suddenly finish the exercise.\n \nShort\n \nThe good news: exercise does not have to take a few hours to take effect. \"The minimum effective amount of exercise is 4 minutes, which is the time for a drum exercise,\" said Josh Holland, a trainer in New York City and founder of Zoomtion Fitness. So, why not start your day with squats or push-ups (20 seconds, 10 seconds rest, 8 reps) while making coffee?\n \nHard to go home\n \nThis is not to say that long-term exercise will not bring more benefits, although Holland said that you only need 20 to 30 minutes, especially when you are training hard. His favorite is your best partner, including slow repetitive high-intensity strength training, aerobic sprinting and endurance isometric tests.\n \nThis weight loss routine is the perfect partner exercise\n \nA cry for you\n \nStrengthen Strength: Choose 5 to 7 multi-joint exercises (such as front squat, overhead press, bench press, low row exercise and pull down exercise), and perform slow repetitive exercises (concentric and eccentric) for about one and a half minutes for each exercise Exercise 5-6 seconds), respectively. Holland said: \"The weight should be heavy enough to make you tired.\"\n \nFor aerobic exercise: choose aerobic exercise mode (running, biking, rowing, even skipping). Go all out for 12 to 15 seconds. Indeed not, do your best, this is not a half-way time. Recover up to one minute (up to three minutes), and then recover 6 to 10 times. Holland said: \"When your distance starts to shrink, then it's time for you to quit.\"\n \nFor long-lasting: This fast exercise can be done in your living room using your own body weight. Use wall sitting, planks, handstands or spear rests and lunges rest to create isometric circuits. Move continuously for 1 minute at a time and complete the loop as much as possible until the table fails. Make it more difficult by extending the time.\n \nFor those who are not motivated\n \nFor whatever reason, when you stretch your hips toward the gym, you seem to be dragging your feet. It\u2019s not that you are afraid of it, but because it\u2019s much easier to procrastinate or get yourself into work, such as Netflix or aimless web surfing or coworkers\u2019 happy hours, and suddenly, you are not for the week.\n \nSet a goal\n \nYou\u2019ve heard it before, but if you don\u2019t have a clear intention, it\u2019s difficult to measure progress and you don\u2019t even have the motivation to try. Add numbers to it, such as the specific weight loss you want to achieve within a specific time period (remember that 2 pounds a week is considered healthy and sustainable). Or consider the goal of skill or strength: perfect skipping leg training, lift body weight (or 1.5 times or twice the body weight) on the bench or deadlift, pull up 10 or 20 pull-ups, master the muscles, and start Exercise the number of miles within a certain time frame and so on. \"Using test and retest models,\" Holland said. Set a benchmark and then conduct a self-test once a week or every two weeks to assess progress.\n \nLet others hold you accountable\n \nAn exercise partner who is already a gym rat may be your new best friend. Cheer him up by asking for his opinion, suggesting to provide a whistleblower, or keeping up with him, you need someone to whip your ass. Or even promise to pay for the smoothie after exercise to help you get up and drag you there, and don\u2019t let him refuse."

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes."

And there is some value in it, if only just for entertainment sometimes (especially on the internet). But let's just get one thing straight here - if you are doing \nany\n kind of workout then it's going to have a greater impact than if you weren't. Simple as that.\n \nOf course there are caveats. You don't want to get hurt, so they can pretty much all be summed up into one commandment: Thou shalt not be an idiot. Getting under a bar loaded with 495 lbs and squatting it is an experience reserved for a very small percentage of people. There is zero reason to think that you need to do that unless you are 100% sure you can. And the people that do it take safety precautions when they do because they know s@&t can go sideways for the best of us so it makes sense to be prepared. That doesn't mean don't lift heavy. It \ndoes\n mean that heavy is a relative concept, not an absolute one. If 95 lbs feels super-heavy to you on bench then guess what? It is. The dude on the bench next to you repping 315 is not relevant to your perception.\n \nYou know all the things people like to give huge importance to? Things like \u201cHow long should I rest between sets?\u201d, \u201cHow many reps should I do?\u201d, \u201cAre preacher curls better than standing curls?\u201d, \u201cShould I drink a protein shake during my workout or after? How long after?\u201d \u2026 are all interesting questions but the truth is the answers have more to do with refinement than gross progress. Get in, lift weights, eat food and don't be an idiot and you will build muscle.\n \nThen there's cardio. Want to create a calorie deficit? Do cardio. Want to improve your heart\u2019s performance? Do cardio. Should you do HIIT? Sure. Why not. Should you do long, slow duration? Sounds good. My rule for cardio is this: if you're just putting in the time then you won't get too much out of it. Come up with little challenges for yourself and then beat them. Maybe it's a certain calories/minute average. Maybe it's maintaining a certain speed for a certain time. Maybe it's keeping your heart rate above a certain number. Maybe it's that you want your shirt to be fully drenched when you're done. Whatever it is I promise that setting a goal and then beating it will ensure your cardio has an impact. Getting too detailed about it is great for refinement but once again the gross value is in making it happen.\n \nMost of us who train won't be Mr. Olympia, or win an Ironman triathlon. At the elite levels there are little refinements that need to be made, but those vary on an individual basis. For the general population who wants to be fit, healthy and strong (and look good along the way) overthinking is overwhelming. As Nike so perfectly puts it, just do it."

They want the Honda Accord body.\n \nWhich means a routine that has cardio, strength and mobility. Emphasis should be on cardio, since it's longer to build and quicker to lose. Try for three 30 minute cardio sessions a week. Running, biking, swimming, whatever gets your heart rate up. If you can't go 30 minutes, slow down until you can.\n \nSupplement this with strength and mobility exercises, either after the cardio or a different day. If you have access to weights, then stick with the major lifts: bench press, squat, deadlift, overhead press, lat pull down. If you don't, then use bodyweight exercises: push ups, pull ups, squats, planks and glute bridges. Finish up with stretches for mobility. Yoga is good for this too.\n \nOnce you know more about fitness and your body, you might decide you want the pick up truck body (weightlifters) the sprinter body (sports car) the long distance body (hybrid) or the obstacle course body (jeep). All are worthy goals, but if you're not sure, then start with the Accord."

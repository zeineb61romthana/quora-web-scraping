            "text": "No, it is generally not recommended to do weightlifting every day. Muscles need time to rest and recover between weightlifting sessions in order to grow and become stronger. Typical recommendations are to allow 1-2 days of rest between strength training sessions for the same muscle groups. Doing weightlifting every day can lead to overtraining, increased risk of injury, and plateaus in strength gains. A well-designed weightlifting program incorporates planned rest and recovery days to allow the body to adapt and improve."

I've been sober for 18 years.\n \nAt any rate, I stopped lifting weights for 12 or 14 years \u2013 \u2013 and got back into it around 66, after some back surgery, and related aches and pains from an increasingly sedentary lifestyle.\n \nI now lift five days a week. it has literally changed my life. I knew I was somewhat overweight, but I have lost over 20 pounds, while putting on at least 8-10 pounds of muscle \u2013 \u2013 which means I lost close to 30 pounds of fat. It's remarkable how much fat can hide internally (especially in men) in the abdomen!\n \nI watched the clock turn back.\n \nIt's not just that I am stronger and better built \u2013 \u2013 my skin tone/elasticity is noticeably better, my mood is brighter, my energy level is much greater \u2013 \u2013 my general sense of well-being and \u2013 \u2013 \"alive-ness\" \u2014 feels like I have returned to my 40s.\n \nThere is more and more evidence that intelligent weightlifting \u2013 \u2013 consistent, and intense enough to be genuinely challenging \u2013 \u2013 can not only retard the aging process, but to some degree, reverse it.\n \nThat has certainly been my experience. Of course, my stamina is not what it was 30 years ago, and 45/50 minutes of intense work is my limit, unless I push so hard that I stop looking forward to workouts \u2013 \u2013 and run the risk of losing focus toward the end \u2013 \u2013 which is when you inevitably hurt yourself.\n \nSo I do one body part a day \u2014 actually, I divide legs up, and do some legwork on three of those days to make it less brutal \u2013 \u2013 and I continue to make real progress, look forward to my workouts, and I do not in anyway feel I am over-training.\n \nI think every-day is pushing it. But you can definitely do more than three days a week, if you want to \u2014 if you do it intelligently, find what works for you (for me, it is weights heavy enough that I am limited to 6\u20138 reps per set in most cases), and FOCUS INTENTLY ON EVERY REP TO AVOID INJURY.\n \nMy experience is that five days a week is healthy, fun, and productive. And if you stick with it and push yourself just enough \u2013 \u2013 the results can be nothing short of magical."

After a game, I strode confidently into the Kansas City Royals\u2019 weight room, rested the weight bar on my shoulders and settled in for some heavy squats.  I rocked my hips back and dropped into my form, feeling totally in control. On the way back up, I got stuck. I leaned forward and the bar spilled over my neck. More than 500 pounds went violently crashing to the floor and members of both teams turned to look.\n \nLuckily, nothing was injured that day other than my pride.  It could have been much worse.  I was over-trained; I had an intense weight training session the day before and was just coming off playing nine innings.  \u201cMore is better\u201d was my mantra, but I was na\u00efve.\n \nAt 23, I lifted heavy weights every day. Now, I lift three days a week. I\u2019m not quite as strong, but I\u2019m inching closer to that 500 pound threshold now that I understand the importance of rest and recovery.  If I understood how the body repairs itself when I was a rookie, I would have been stronger, healthier, and a better baseball player.\n \nIt\u2019s essential to incorporate recovery days into your program so your muscles can adequately repair themselves, grow and become stronger. When we train with weights, we actually create small tears in our muscle fibers. Those fibers then repair and rebuild bigger and stronger while we rest.  If you don\u2019t build in that downtime, you break the muscle fibers down further reducing the chance for solid growth and increasing the risk of injury.\n \nIf your ultimate goal is size and strength, avoid weight training, even targeting separate muscle groups, on consecutive days.\n \nYour body only builds muscle when you are not weight training.  Trust the process, believe in the value of rest, and you\u2019ll be significantly stronger as a result."

            "text": "It depends on the person. I lift for an hour to hour and a half every day. No days off. I run 3\u20136 miles a day, no days off. Work, life, or children will force missed training. The reality is it\u2019s tough to stay disciplined, but the mental state and physical conditioning are rewarding. Some will tell you that it is bad for you. Most of those have never tried to do it. If it\u2019s your passion, go for it. If you start to get injuries, dial it back. I am close to 50 and my piers are suffering from far worse conditions stemmed from a sedimentary life style. Its also nice to out pace skinny guys as a bodybuilder."

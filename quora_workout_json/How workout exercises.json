Overemphasizing one over the other is also wrong as a balanced approach has to be taken. \u201cModeration\u201d and \u201cConsistency\u201d are the keys.\n \nAll one needs is \nmax 1 hour/day\n which you should definitely be able to find. Based on my own experience and some literature and books I read I have tried to sum up the basics of these components below.\n \n1)\n \nStrength Training\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nFirst let us understand what it is not. It is often misunderstood as bulking up and building 6-packs ab and Salman like biceps for show-off. So most people feel that they don\u2019t really need it. WRONG!\n \nIt is actually defined as a type of anaerobic physical exercise that by the use of resistance specializes in\n \n>\nIncreasing Muscular Fitness (Increases muscle strength, muscle mass and size)\n \n>Increasing Bone Strength and bone density\n \n>Increasing Tendon and Ligament Strength\n \n>Improving Joint Function\n \nApart from these benefits in aids in health improvement ,increases metabolism, aids in fat loss, overall fitness levels ,improved lipid profile (improves the good cholesterol) etc.\n \nHence it is absolutely critical component.\n \nHow you can do It :- \nOne has following options to do it.\n \na)\n \nAt Gym using various equipments\n :- You can perform it at GYM. All you need to make sure is that you need to have a good sensible trainer.\n \nYou may do it 2-3 times/week for an hour each.\n \nb)\n \nAt Home using Resistance band\n :- This is another option that you may perform at your home. You may order the band online (Cosco is a good brand),some good videos (10 min-30 min) are available online to learn and do the exercises along with the video. Convenience is better in this option but the drawback is that you won\u2019t have good control on the exact amount of resistance. But it can be done on days when you look for some light strength sessions.\n \nc)\n \nAt Home using Body weight\n :- The 5 basic strength exercises \u2013 Push Up ,Pull Up, Dips, Sit-ups and Squats are key to overall strength. Rather than working on isolated muscles they work on large muscle groups. You may do these in conjunction with band/dumbbells or standalone also. You can also do exercises like Lunges, Mountain Climbers, bridges etc.\n \nd)\n \nAt Home using dumbbells \n:- If you know the basics right you may perform the entire exercises that you do on equipments in a Gym at your home only. You can do good variations with just a set of \n2 and 5 kgs of dumbbells\n using proper form and by doing the moves slowly. This can be started at any age by using a set of 2 Kg dumbbells and is often a most neglected part.\n \nDon\u2019t forget to warm up before starting the strength training sessions. You may like to wind up with a 5 min stretching session.\n \n2)\n \nCardio Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters \n:- Cardio is any form of exercise/activity that is designed to work the cardiovascular system that raises your heart rate and breathing and consequently an increase in the circulation of blood and oxygen throughout the body for an extended period of time. Getting your body to sweat also helps you to release toxins that would otherwise build up in your tissues. The benefits range from weight loss, improved Heart health, improved Lung health, improved stamina, improved immunity, stabilized blood pressure,increased energy levels,more active and dynamic lifestyle, reduced mood swings etc.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nYou may\n \nenjoy any of the below/club them/etc. to get the benefits. Go for a variety rather than repeating the same all the time.\n \na)\n \nFast Walking/Light Jogging :- \nJust go to a park nearby and enjoy fresh unpolluted morning air, get some sunlight and do fast walk/light jog to start the day.\n \nb)\n \nTreadmill /Elliptical machine/stationary cycling \n:- Good for those rainy seasons\n \nc)\n \nCycling \n:- You may incorporate use of a bicycle to go to nearby places etc. or do it as a part of exercise weekly.\n \nd)\n \nSwimming \n:- One of the best cardio exercises. Just use googles and caps to avid the chlorine side effects.\n \ne)\n \nAerobic Dance Workouts \n:- In Youtube you have some good videos that you may see and do along.\n \nf)\n \nP-T exercises \n:- Remember the school days. Those exercises can still be incorporated.\n \ng)\n \nStair climbing \n:- Avoid lifts and take stairs.\n \nh)\n \nRope Jumping\n :- Good if you enjoy it.\n \n3)\n \nFlexibility Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters \n:- Flexibility may be defined as the ability of our joints and body parts to execute their full range of motion. Flexibility deteriorates rapidly with a sedentary lifestyle and without adequate flexibility you are more prone to injuries and with tight muscles daily activities become difficult to perform. We create body movement and posture habits which tend to reduce joint mobility. The benefits of flexibility exercises are less back pain, increased range of motion, injury prevention ,improved circulation, less stress, better posture and confidence. A flexible body a flexible spine ultimately leads to a flexible mind which is more adaptive . Practicing Yogaasanas daily is the most perfect and easiest way to obtain a flexible body and a clear mind It would help one to tone the muscles, skeletal system, nourish the body tissues and burn fat. It is excellent for all internal organs and various yoga asanas target specific parts and organs of the body like vertebra, Joints, neck, shoulder, heart, lungs, kidney etc. It will also improve your balance both physical and emotional.\n \nHow you can do it \n:- As I have already written above that YOGAASANAS are the most perfect way to flexibility.. You don\u2019t have to do complicated postures at all , just simple basic stretching asanas have to be done with awareness of breath. You really have to be at ease during each posture and you shouldn\u2019t feel any pain. One very good 22 minute video is that of a sequence called \u201cPadmasadhna\u201d which consists of 12 yogaasanas, it is taught in Art of living advance course but can be easily practiced by anyone. You may also learn asanas from any yoga instructor near your place, but you can learn simple asanas yourselves with videos.One video called Shilpa Yoga is also very well designed. Below are some common asanas which you can simply google :-\n \na)\n \nLying Asanas\n:-Ardha Halasana,Sethu Bandhasana,Naukasana,Makarasana,Shalabhasana,Bhujangasana,Dhanurasana,Kativakraasana and shavasana\n \nb)\n \nSitting Asanas\n \n:- Vrajrasana,Parvatasana,Shashankasana,Marjariasana,Vyaghrasana,Janu Shirshasana,Gomukhasana,Padmasana,Budhkonasana and Adho Mukh Shvanasana\n \nc)\n \nStanding Asanas\n:-Tadasana,Prishtasana,Padhastasana,Vriksasana,Natrajasana,Utkatasana,Trikonasana,Veer Bhradraasana,Konasana and Kati chakrasana.\n \n4)\n \nBreathing Exercises\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nBreathing exercises are basically an activity that would involve taking breaths consciously. Every emotion has an impact on our breath eg when we are happy and relaxed we breathe deeply, when we are in anger we automatically take short breaths etc. Now our motive is to control these emotions/feelings but we often find ourselves not able to keep them under control. The best way to achieve this is through control of breath ,when we do breathing exercises and learn conscious breathing we are able to control our emotions as well, it\u2019s like a remote control to our emotions. If we observe ourselves there are two type of actions a) Voluntary b) Involuntary. Voluntary actions are the ones that we do consciously like talking, walking, moving our hands, eating drinking etc. .Involuntary actions are the actions that are taken care of by the conscious energy that resides within us like conversion of oxygen to carbon dioxide by our cells, digestion of food, pumping of blood by our heart ,all cellular actions etc. The thing with breath is that when we are not aware of it, it is involuntary but when we become aware of it and start breathing with awareness it becomes voluntary and we can control it. Hence it is a transit between Voluntary to Involuntary, Known to Unknowable, manifested to Unmanifested it is a jump into the divine. Hence breathing exercises or pranayama have found an unique place in our Vedas, yoga pradipikas, yoga sutras and more recently in Medical Science as well .\n \nOur lung function is obviously improved and more quantity of oxygen reaches and nourishes every single cell that restores health, youthfulness and cheerfulness.\n \nHow you can do it :- T\nhey may be classified as the nature of breaths we take\n \na) slow/deep/long breaths eg Anulom Vilom & Nadi Shodhan (Alternate Nostril Breathing), Deep Ujvai Breaths,3- Stage Pranayama, Simple Deep Breathing, Abdominal Breathing\n \nb) short/rapid/quick blasts of breaths eg. Kappal Bhatti,\n \nc) cyclic rhythm including a blend of both eg\n. \nSudarshan Kriya\n \nas taught in the Art of Living\n \n5)\n \nMeditation\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nMeditation is actually \u201cDoing Nothing\u201d. You just sit with eyes closed and just as a witness observe your own thoughts without judging without comparing without imagining, without labeling. It gives us deep rest, far deeper than what sleep offers you. Meditation makes you more Dynamic, more lively, more focused, improves your concentration, improves your happiness quotient, highly raises your healing power. Other benefits are\n \n>Keeps you stress free\n \n>Reduces aging\n \n>Helps you to appreciate life more\n \n>Helps you feel more connected\n \n>Improves Brain Function\n \n>Helps you give good sleep\n \n>Increases Immunity\n \n>Increases your awareness and attention\n \n>You gain control over your mind\n \nIn this 10 minutes you would realise that how our mind exaggerates and magnifies small problems in life and that you have immense potential to face all challenges of life. The most important realization that occurs is that actually \nno incidence or no person or no situation is joyous or sorrowful, it is actually the \u201cSELF-TALK\u201d that we do with ourselves is the source of joy/misery\n. After that even when situations come which tend to make you tensed/stressed by positive self-talk you increase the power of the self and don\u2019t let the negative talks of mind over power you.\n \nWe develop love and compassion with others and let go of our habit of Criticizing, complaining and comparing.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nMeditation should be practiced daily for around 10 minutes. Some guided meditations are available online. You just need to listen to it and let go. You don\u2019t have to do anything, just listen and relax. Initially guided meditations are beneficial, slowly once you get the basics you may not actually need them. You can simple sit and meditate. Just remember that it is not concentration, it is de-concentration.\n \nWe just have to make a schedule for ourself and then stick to it remembering that \n\u201c Self Discipline\u201d is the only thing that makes someone miserable/blissfull,healthy/unhealthy,strong/week\n.\n \n6)\n \nA Balanced Diet\n \nWhat is it and Why it matters :- \nJust remember the basic fact that \u201cYou are what you eat\u201d. You would need to get all your macronutrients (carbohydrate, Protein ,fat and water) and all your micronutrients (Vit A, Vit B Complex (B1,B2,B3,B5,B6,B7,B9 and B12),Vit C, Vit D, Vit E,Vit K,calcium,magnesium,iron,zinc,selenium,phosphorous etc ) in order to allow your body to function optimally. I would advise just spend an hour on internet and surf about these nutrients.\n \nHow you can do it :- \nFirst let us discuss about some basic points related to diet :-\n \na)\n \nMindful eating and chewing each bite till it turns liquid\n \n: - Eat mindfully with thankfulness and chew each bite at least 64 times that enhances digestion and nutrient absorption.\n \nb)\n \nAvoid\n all \nFried Products\n (Samosa, Vada, Pakoda, Papad etc.), All \nMaida\n products-Bread , Paw , Naan , Tandoori Roti made of Maida , Bakery Products , Maggi ,Noodles etc., All \nPacket\n Food- Farsana , Mixtures , Chips , Kurkure, Ready to eat products , etc., All \nFast \nFood- Pizza , Burger ,sauces, Junk Food , Hotel Food ,KFC, Mc Donald\u2019s, Chinese Food etc., All \nFatty\n Food-Butter , Cream , Peanut Butter, Nutrilite , Mayonnaise etc\n \nAnd especially for phenytoin you have to stay away from all sodas and cold drinks also.\n \nc)\n \nRefined White Sugar\n :- This is the most dangerous food item on our shelves .It is rightly termed as \u201cWhite Poison\u201d by nutrition experts. Completely eliminate the use of refined white sugar. Date Syrup, Honey and Jaggery are better alternatives as they contain important nutrients , although they should also be consumed within limits as they have high Glycemic Index. Avoid All \nsugar\n Products- Sweets, Cold Drinks ,Chocolates ,Biscuits, Ice-creams, Pastries, Cakes, Tea, Coffee etc.\n \nd)\n \nFruits\n :- Include seasonal fruits a part of your daily food list. Definitely include Guava or peru (for highest Vitamin C), Awla (for highest antioxidants) , Carrot ( for highest vitamin A) daily. Additionally have fruits like pomengranate ,oranges,papaya,banana,apple etc. You should aim for 2-3 servings/day\n \ne)\n \nGrains\n :- Go for variety,don\u2019t restrict you to just one.Ideally try to have one grain only once per day .Have wheat,brown rice,white rice,wheat,ragi,jowar,bajra,Makai.\n \nf)\n \nPulses and Legumes \n:- Select from wide variety of Moong,masoor,arhar dals etc and beans like kidney beans soya beans,chick peas etc as they are high in protein content.\n \ng)\n \nOmega 3 Fatty Acids\n :- Extremely critical to be included in the diet on daily basis. Flaxseeds, Walnuts , Fish and cod liver oil are good sources.You may occasionaly use a cod liver oil supplement\n \nh)\n \nAcid-Alkaline balance\n :- Almost all cooked food tend to have an acidic effect on the body. Try to include raw fruits and vegetables daily to restore the balance.\n \ni)\n \nSeeds and Nuts\n :- Include them daily in your diet plan. Remember to soak the nuts (including peanut ) as un soaked nuts have very high amount of phylates that interfere in Iron absorption.\n \nNuts \u2013 Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Dates, Raisins,\n \nSeeds \u2013 Flaxseeds, Sesame seeds(in winter) , Sunflower seeds, Chia seeds, Basil seeds , Pumpkin seeds.\n \nInclude some roasted gram (Chana), Sattu drink and handful of Sprouts in your daily diet plan.\n \nj)\n \nCooking Oil\n :- never use a single cooking oil all the time. Use a blend of cooking oils, have one for breakfast, another for lunch and another for dinner. Aim for varieties of which one is high in MUFA, one high in PUFA and one which has both in balance .Just see the labels of the cooking oil. Use olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil ,groundnut oil, safflower oil, rice bran oil, coconut oil etc. and keep shuffling between them. The daily intake should be restricted. Ghee could also be used wisely in some quantity. The important thing to remember is that never eat FRIED foods and cook vegetables in less quantity of oil .\n \nk)\n \nAyurvedic Herbs \n:- Use herbs in medicinal form occasionally to boost immunity. Eg Tulsi, Neem, Triphala, Ashwagandha, Guduchhi etc.\n \nl)\n \nVeg Vs Nonveg \n:- Its totally a personal choice. Whilst Non Veg food are rich sources of nutrients like protein and iron they do have an array of drawbacks. One has to decide for himself. I benefitted hugely by switching to being vegetarian from part 3-4 years.\n \nNeedless to mention in the above list that Alcoholic Products, Cigarettes, Tobacco etc. are a Big NO! Remember that our body is the temple where God resides in the form of our soul/consciousness/energy whatever we may like to call it. We are all divine beings and this body is a precious miraculous gift from divinity to us, we should never disrespect it by the intake of such products. \u201cWe are not human beings on a spiritual journey , we are spiritual beings on a human journey\u201d hence the best way to show gratitude to divinity is by taking care of your body!\n \nThe above components if integrated properly would surely raise the self-healing abilities of your body. Just have faith that there is a cosmic intelligence that has fine-tuned the entire universe eg. mass of electron, gravitational constant, electromagnetic constant, distance between earth and sun, composition of air that we breathe and millions of such parameters had to be exactly the same as they are for you and me to exist. Within our cells lies the same intelligence that is driving billions of galaxies. Each cell has the same intelligence by which it is able to perform such complicated functions with such an ease. Each cell in the body is like an universe in itself. This intelligence is working all the time within you and can definitely re fine tune the parameters of your body that have gone out of order. Just set your priorities right and you can surely manage one hour/day ,let these things be an integral part of your life like you brush your teeth, you bath these also shall be included in your daily routine.\n \nHope this helps,\n \nI belong to you! Thanks."

Depending on my fitness level, exercise could be as simple as taking a short walk to increase my heart rate and blood flow.\n \nI don't need an intense workout such as heavy weightlifting or high-intensity interval training (HIIT).\nHow I exercise depends on my health goals. For example, if I want to lose fat and gain muscle, I will focus on heavy compound movements. In addition, my diet is extremely critical.\n \nTo keep myself motivated, I measure my results. Furthermore, I don't compare myself to others because everyone\u2019s body is different. Every person has his or her unique different genetics, health, and fitness history. The only person I compare to is my former self.\n \nI focus on my progress.\n \nPersistence and consistency are the two key factors for achieving my goals.\n \nBreak Through Your Plateau\n \nAfter reaching a certain fitness level, your body will stagnate because it has adapted to those changes. This is great if your goal is to maintain. But if you want to break through the plateau, your body must experience a higher intensity or resistance.\n \nThis is when progressive overload applies.\n \nTo get stronger and have more muscle for a particular body part, your body must experience a higher amount of resistance.\n \nFor example, if you can lift 125 pounds for your barbell military press for 4 to 6 reps and you want more strength and muscles in your shoulders, you must increase the weights during your workouts. Along with proper macronutrients fueling and rest, you will gain more strength and shoulder definition over time.\nBut the process could take longer if you want to increase muscle and strength while minimizing fat. To do so, you can first bulk to gain fat and muscle. Afterward, you can cut to maintain muscle while losing fat.\n \nHowever, if you're new to weightlifting, you can quickly build muscle while losing fat.\n \nFocus on Exercises which Excite You\n \nIf your goal is to maintain optimal health, then performing enjoyable exercises will be your most desirable and sustainable approach. That's because you're more likely to exercise if you look forward to them. Such options might be a dance class, morning group hike, or a run with your dog.\n \nFor example, one of my personal favorite hobbies is rock-climbing.\nAlthough it's challenging, I look forward to going to the rock-climbing gym because I find it extremely fun and engaging. It's both physically and mentally difficult because I have many ways of finishing the problem.\n \nWorking out with a partner can make your exercise session even more enjoyable, not to also mention accountability - you both don't want to let the other person down. In addition to improving your health, you get to spend quality time with them which further deepends your relationship.\n \nProducing many health benefits, exercise is an excellent way to release endorphins, ..."

It isn't as tiring or grueling on your joints as it is when you're doing runs on varied, uneven, and realistic terrain.\n \nI liked going to the gym and rotating between lifting machines like the bicep curl, tricep press, and tricep pushdown when I wanted to blow off steam; but the muscle soreness and stiffness that I got in the inboard side of my elbow (known as the medial epicondyle) was excruciating every time I tried to straighten my arm a day after the workout.\n \nAs a result, I'd have to go to work the next day with my arms squared off in a stiff, rigid, and 45-degree angle. My arms being bent at the elbow and unable to extend without causing agony. People thought I was playing around, \u201cLook at this dick walking around trying to make chicken sandwiches with his robot arms.\u201d\n \nSo cardio became my go to. Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December, and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n \n(Upvote for the Edgar Allan Poe reference? )\n \nI went to exercise at L.A Fitness with a gym rat who practically snorted canisters of preworkout and whey protein. And he had a free guest pass, so I said what the hell. I got the heart, kid! I was always at the disadvantage, but I doggedly followed his workout routine despite feeling I was over training my muscles.\n \nThe days that we were too worn out or didn't have enough time to go through with a full workout, we treated them as cardio days. Immediately, I fell in love with the treadmill.\n \nThe way Mr.Protein saw it, it was either go home with your mind carrying your agonized and hypertrophic corpse in a body bag, or do cardio until you dropped.\n \nSo I grew fond of working to a beat, treading on the elastic band that bounced with a slight resistance as it looped under my feet, and seeing the gorgeous female triathletes who seemed to have unparalleled stamina run alongside me.\n \nI'd start off getting started at a slow and steady 3.5 MPH and would gradually increase the speed by .2 every minute. Often, I'd swap my playlist to an upbeat and fast BPM playlist to challange myself to what I deemed a speed round.\n \nRaised the incline, raised the speed to 6.0 MPH, and raised the resistance. And every twenty seconds, I'd increase the speed by .20\n \nBefore all this, I was always confused as to why people enjoyed running track or doing seemingly linear sports ike cross-country. But then I tried it for myself in the comfort of a warm gym. It feels like you're running away from it all. Not in a bad way. It feels a bit like you're the last mazerunner burdened with dashing through the labrynth-complex that is life.\n \nThere's a controlled rhythm and willpower, and most of the time you'll be too focused on keeping your lungs supplied with oxygen for you to think about much else. It's a fascinating workout all-in-all.\n \nCheers,\n \nDaniel.\n \nSources :\n \nGolfer's elbow - Symptoms and causes"

I hated running in middle and high school (anything before, I probably enjoyed, but don't remember much), mostly because it was forced upon me by the school administration in the form of pacers and the infamous 1 mile runs. \n \nOnce college hit and I began to realize that my health is actually on my shoulders, I ventured into the world of yoga, mainly because it doesn't involve any kind of traditional cardio (i.e. running). I never tried bikram, but hard-core classes like power yoga or advanced vinyasa flow made you sweat and toned and super freakishly flexible. I began jogging when I realized that my heart rate wasn't going as fast as when I first started, and weirdly enough it didn't feel like a work-out without breathing hard. \n \nThe first time I ran more than 2 miles was mind-boggling. And then I ran a 5k (on my own, not in a race and rather slowly), I literally thought I was dreaming and pinched myself. Compared to other avid runners, I'm quite slow, I average probably 10min/mile to 12min/mile depending on the day, but each time I hit another distance (like 5 miles, etc) or time goals (like 5k in 30min, etc), it hooked me. Of course I have days where I absolutely loath putting my running shoes, so I substitute yoga. \n \nOne thing that I have noticed with running more often for longer times and distances is that you can get extremely tight quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, gastrocnemius, essentially all your leg muscles and your abs. So I'm not as stretchy and yoga is actually a bit more painful (I appreciate wooden people's yoga feats more now), which in turn led me to more running. So lots of stretching and sprinkling of yoga along with some healthy goals and good running shoes resulted in this weird love for running. :)"

Sit back and down, in a similar way to sitting on an imaginary chair directly behind, taking care to go down as much as possible without bending the upper body more than several centimeters forward, and not allowing the knees to go beyond the toes. Stand up straight again.\n \nBench press\n \nThis exercise can be done by following these steps:\n \nLie on the back under the barbell strap, and make sure that the shoulders, head, and butt are on the bench, with a slight bend in the spine, and the feet should be flat on the floor, slightly apart. Experiment with raising the bar to warm up without adding additional weights, and add weights when you feel able to lift them. Hold the bar in such a way that the thumbs are outside the closed fist, and the arms are separated from each other a distance greater than the width of the shoulders, taking care that the angle between the arm from the top and the body is about 45 degrees. Bring the weight closer to the chest before lowering it towards the chest, taking care not to lower the weight directly from its original position without bringing it close to the chest. Take a deep breath and raise the bar again above the chest, with the arms extended, and exhale during the lifting process with a focus on a specific point in the ceiling, then return the bar above the chest, and repeat the exercise"

You can climb actual stairs or you can use a stair machine at a gym. Climbing stairs improves your leg muscles as well as your butt. Be careful if using actual stairs, however, as you do not want to fall and get seriously injured.\n \nJump rope. This is not just a fun game for children but also an excellent workout. Working the arms, legs and core muscles, this is an exercise that you can easily do at home. It is also well known for improving balance and is excellent for people who intend to play sports.\n \nDo jumping jacks. Jumping jacks are an exercise performed by standing with the legs together, arms at your side, and then jumping to move the legs outward and raising the arm together above your head. Jump again to return to the starting position. These are great for getting your heart rate up and burning calories.\n \nSwim. Swimming is great exercise and is fun to boot. This will work different muscles depending on the style of swimming you do. Swimming is frequently recommended for people with joint problems or those that are significantly overweight, as it can take a great deal of strain off of the skeleton while still raising the heart rate.\n \n`\ufffdqU\ufffd(\u0002"

So if you want big and strong muscles that can withstand the test of time and whatever life throws at you, I recommend you do both. Follow a varied routine that challenges your body in both ways, one week of each, constantly alternating. Doing the same workout every week is both boring and not productive. There is no magical number of sets. When going for mechanical stress it is possible to achieve the desired effect after only 1 set, just make sure warming up properly. When the muscle tissue is torn and damaged, it will start a regenerating process that rebuilds and reinforces the damaged area. Normally it is ok to perform 2 and even 3 sets of this kind of tissue-breaking training, and 2 exercises will be plenty, making sure to hit the muscle from different angles and causing growth in a large area. \n \nFor the metabolical stress effect you will need more reps and less weights, but again- there is no magical number of exercises. Do as many as you want to, and I recommend you superset them or giantset them, in order to hit the same muscle from many different angles, all in one highrep round of exercises. I like to do 3 exercises on each musclegroup, for 3 rounds of trisets, when doing this kind of training. It can come up to a total of 45 reps on one round, doing 15 reps on 3 exercises with no rest in between, on the same muscle. it will give you the most insane feeling of pump, and surely cause a very good environment for growth. The levels of natural growth hormones is highly affected by this, and this is the reason why people call the high-rep range hypertrophy training. It usually takes 3 exercises to train a muscle from all the relevant angles/lengths, so that answers your question I guess."

The best option is the circuits in which four or five different types of activities alternate with rest periods between series and series . Coaches say that without killing themselves and choosing the activity table, the body will notice in 66 days.\nPlan the session; Exhausting is not a guarantee of good results\n \nWhat is better, to train strength or resistance? We are facing the eternal question when it comes to exercising. We arise because we have little time in day to day and we want, logically, to get the most out of our activity. But choosing between both is a wrong view, since it leads us in most cases to the mistake of hitting an aerobic bludgeon, thinking that with it we will burn more fats , or routines with a lot of weight in order to gain more muscle.\n \nThe reality is that people who manage to train continuously do so on average twice a week and no more than forty minutes each time . With this average, if we want to generate significant changes in our body to improve health and aesthetics, we have to change our perspective. By focusing one day on muscle mass and another on aerobic exercises, the stimulus to which the body is subjected is insignificant, even if we end up exhausted.\nThe reason is that the organism does not know if it runs in front of a lion to survive - and is making an extra effort for it - or if it trains for a healthy goal. So, if you are sitting for eight hours or so many hours standing up and suddenly an intense and unordered physical activity is imposed, your tendency will be to protect yourself. It will neither burn more fat, nor generate more muscle; on the contrary, it will try to reserve itself and spend as little as possible, in case the effort is prolonged in time. Your reaction is biologically logical.\n \nSo, what is the ideal dynamic? The answer is very simple: combine the two modalities in the same session or at different times but within the same day. The professionals call it concurrent training. However, after answering the first question, at least two more questions arise. The first: how much time is necessary to use to notice significant changes in the body? And the second: how to combine strength and resistance exercises in each session?\n \nThe magic figure: nine and a half weeks\n \nThe University College of London sets at 66 the days necessary to generate or change a habit or to achieve the goal that we set. You rarely get to the ten weeks of training followed. Most of us move by peaks of intensity. There are two periods that are key: the beginning of the year, when many people join a gym or start running; and towards the month of May, coinciding with the fact that the first hot days make us see summer around the corner.\nMany coaches propose that we divide our goals into blocks of 66 days. This will not only help us see results, but also motivate us with a goal that has a beginning and an end. Once you have made the decision, you have to plan the exercise with realism. How much time do I train? The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week spread over five days - a half hour a day - or three sessions of between twenty minutes and one hour of vigorous activity .\n \nThis is ideal, however, the perfect dose is one that is compatible with the activities of daily and working life in the medium and long term. To achieve the goal, you have to be practical. Therefore, every session we take, even if it is ten minutes, should be used to the maximum and have all the necessary components so that our health improves little by little.\nA circuit with which we could start today would be this:\n \n1) 200 meters running or walking ;\n \n2) Ten squats;\n \n3) Eight push-ups.\n \n4) Six vertical jumps and return to run or walk 200 meters.\n \nWe should do it twice, with thirty seconds of rest between each exercise and two minutes of rest between circuit and circuit. The training lasts between twenty-five and thirty minutes."

I also went to weightlifting school to learn the basics.\n \nMy workouts include deadlifts variants, squats exercises, overhead pressing activities, many variants of these compound routines. These exercises are the fundamentals designed for maximum strength-building benefits. I will always keep them in my fitness plan.\n \nI also spend plenty of time training with Weightlifting routines, practicing with barbell snatch, clean and jerk variants. I enjoy these lifts and benefit enormously from regularly practicing these exciting routines. These exercises promote power development, agility, speed, high mobility. I am highly mobile for my age, thanks to these workouts.\n \nMy workouts usually begin with pull up/push-ups, some dumbbell drills, and sometimes kettlebell workouts, then continue with either deadlifts or squats, but always include plenty of snatches, cleans, some light benching, power cleans, lots of lightweight air squats, etc. On deadlifts days, I use conventional deadlifts, clean-style deads, Romanian deadlifts, etc. For squats, the back squats, front squats using Safety Squat bar, or the straight bar.\n \nI also enjoy walking, doing yard work, and doing physical stuff. I miss tire -flipping workouts; I may look for a used tractor tire this summer.\n \nOh, I conduct my fitness project at home in my garage, sometimes use the backyard.\n \nThank You\n \nDisclaimer:\n \nMansour\u2019s disclaimer:\n \nDon't do anything stupid and get hurt lifting big weights after reading some of my answers. It would make us both quite unhappy. Consult a \nMedical Doctor\n, a \nStrength Training coach\n, and \ncommon-sense specialist\n before doing anything you may read in some of my answers.\n \nMedical Considerations"

Do pull-ups and some kind of ab work like hanging leg raises or vacuums ever day.\n \nDoing few exercises and working really hard on them will give you far better results than doing 3 exercises per muscle group\n \nIt is possible to overwork a muscle group, but over training is over-worried-about. I work out my back, grip, and legs every single day. Your body will adapt to whatever you throw at it as long as you sleep, and eat well. \n \nGood luck!\n \nNate"

All these\"workouts\" may work great things for your health. They will keep your weight in check, improve your balance and range of motion, strengthen your muscles, protect your muscles, stop bladder control issues, and also ward off memory loss.\n \nIndependent of your age or fitness level, these actions are a Few of the very best exercises that you can do and can Help You to Get in shape and Decrease Your risk for disorder:\n \n1. Swimming\nYou may call swimming the ideal workout.\n \nStudies have discovered that swimming may also enhance your mental condition and set you in a much better mood. Water Resistant is another choice.\n \n2. Tai chi\nA combination of movement and comfort is perfect for the mind and body. In reality, Tai chi is a Chinese martial art that has been known as\"meditation in movement.\" Since the courses are offered at different degrees, tai chi is available - and beneficial - for everybody and every age and fitness levels. \"It is especially great for elderly people because equilibrium is a significant part of fitness, and equilibrium is something we lose as we age,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nHave a course that will assist you to get started and find out the appropriate form. It is possible to locate tai chi apps at the regional YMCA, gym, community center, or senior center.\n \n3. Strength training\nLifting light weights will not bulk up your muscles, but it is going to keep them strong. \"If you do not use muscles, then they will lose their power over time,\" Dr. Lee says.\n \nComparable to additional exercise, strength training might also help maintain brain function in later decades.\n \nBefore beginning a weight training program, make sure you learn the appropriate form. Start mild, with only a couple of lbs. You ought to be able to lift the weights 10 days easily. After a few weeks, raise this by a pound or 2. If you're able to easily lift the weights through the whole selection of movement over 12 days, then move up to marginally heavier weight.\n \n4. Walking\nWalking is easy yet secure. Additionally, it can help you keep lean, enhance cholesterol levels, fortify bones, and keep blood pressure in check, raise your mood, and decrease your risk for any range of diseases (diabetes and cardiovascular disease, by way of instance ). A variety of studies have revealed that walking and other physical actions can even enhance memory and withstand age-related memory reduction.\n \nAll you will need is a well-fitting and inviting pair of sneakers. Begin with walking for approximately 10 to15 minutes at one time. As time passes, you may begin to walk further and faster, until you are walking for 30 to 60 minutes most days of this week.\n \n5. Kegel exercises\nThese exercises will not allow you to look better. However, they do something equally as significant -- strengthen the pelvic floor muscles which support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles may go a long way toward preventing puberty. When many women are acquainted with Kegels, these exercises may benefit guys also.\n \nSqueeze the muscles you would like to stop yourself from passing gas or urine is the best way to do a Kegel exercise properly. Hold the contraction for a couple of seconds, then release. Be sure that you completely relax your pelvic floor muscles following the decrease. Attempt to perform four to five places every day.\n \nRaking the lawn counts as physical activity. So does ballroom dance and playing with your children or grandkids. Provided that you are doing some aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes each day, and you also comprise two weeks of strength training each week, you may consider yourself a \"busy\" individual."

Too much of anything can be harmful, and too little might not be effective. What you want to do and what you hope to accomplish, will dictate what sort of activity, in what way and how much of it would be healthy for you. So you really need to be more specific. But generaly working out is healthy, as long as you enjoy it, do it regularly, maybe working towards a specific goal, you don\u2019t get injured and so on."

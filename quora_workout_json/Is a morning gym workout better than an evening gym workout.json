You would feel so lazy to skip the gym and put those clothes back in the drawer, so you get up, grab your gym bag, pour a much needed coffee, and head out the door.\n \nThe ride to the gym is peaceful. The world is still asleep, the sun is still down, and you own the road.\n \nYou walk in the gym, a little more energized but still stiff. You\u2019re already here so you might as well get started with some warmups.\n \nThe gym is practically empty and all the equipment is available. You pick your first exercise and begin.\n \nBefore you know it, the initial sleepiness has drifted away and been replaced with a fresh dose of energy.\n \nYou get in the zone, start sweating, and feel your heart pounding as you crush your workout.\n \nForty-five minutes later and you are done. You shower and step out of the gym heading for your car. You remember that the rest of the world is just waking up.\nThe sun is peaking out, the birds are stretching their wings, and the air is filled with slightly more activity than when you first got there.\n \nYou drive to work feeling energized, knowing that you\u2019ve already conquered the day and improved yourself. Regardless of how the rest of the day goes, you know deep down that you already won.\n \nTo top if off, your mind is ready to get to work and you feel free knowing that your evening is completely open.\n \nThis, is the feeling of working out in the morning.\n \nEVENING WORKOUT\n \nThe evening workout has a completely different vibe.\n \nYou wake up at a normal time and head to work with everyone else.\n \nAs the work day starts winding down, you begin thinking about your workout.\n \nIf you\u2019ve eaten healthy during the day, you\u2019re energized and ready to get in there and crush it.\n \nIf you haven\u2019t eaten healthy, you feel sleepiness slowly creeping in.\n \nEither way, you snag a coffee and leave, happy that the work day is over.\n \nAs you sip on your coffee, and listen to your pre-gym music in your car, you start feeling more excited about the gym.\n \nYou\u2019re either happy to be able to leave the stress of work behind you or eager to get to the weights and lift the stress away.\n \nUnlike the morning, you get to the gym and your body and mind are already awake. However, the gym is more crowded at this time of day and you have to strategically pick which exercise to start with.\n \nYou put your headphones in, find an empty machine, and get to work.\n \nThe right song comes on, you start sweating, and you feel your heart pounding as you crush your workout.\n \nAn hour and fifteen minutes later (due to some waiting for machines) you finish up and head for the door. You step out of the gym and head for your car, realizing that the sun is starting to lower on the horizon.\nYou head home feeling pumped that you conquered the day and improved yourself. The day is almost over, but you still have a couple hours to eat, shower, and do whatever you please.\n \nThis, is the feeling of working out in the evening.\nWhich is better?\n \nI can\u2019t make that decision for you.\n \nTest them both out and see what fits your lifestyle.\n \nAt the end of the day, the best time to work out is the one that you actually stick to."

Intervertebral discs are the gel like \u201cspacers\u201d that are found between each of the bones of your spine (aka, vertebrae).\nWhen these discs fill with water, they actually push the bones of the spine (verterbrae) away from each other. This is why you stand slightly taller in the morning, than at night.\n \nSo, first thing in the morning when you get up, these discs are full of water. When you stand up the water starts to run out the discs, and thus you become just a wee-bit shorter.\nOk, but why should I care about water in my discs?\nThe increased water in the discs actually makes the spine stiffer. However, this isn\u2019t a good kind of stiffness.\n \nThis stiffness places a lot of stress on the discs and ligaments vs. the actual soft tissue structures designed to support and protect said discs.\n \nIt takes about an hour of standing for the discs to mostly empty of the water they obtained during sleep.\nSo\u2026can I still workout in the early morning?\nOf course.\n \nBut, if you\u2019re planning to workout within an hour (ish) of getting up you need to be careful about jumping into the following exercises too quickly:\nHeavy back squats or deadlifts \u2192 heavily compresses the spine\nHeavy kettlebell swings \u2192 ballistic hip hinging\nSitups \u2192 flexing your spine through full range of motion\nExcessive bending and twisting movements in general\nBelow are a few good options to get your spine warmed up, before crushing an early morning workout:\nWake up earlier \u2192 gives your spine more time to get back to equilibrium before hitting the gym\nGo for a brisk walk or light jog, before hitting the weights \u2192 moving around helps reduce spine stiffness a little faster\nExtend your warmup \u2192 if you normally warmup for 5\u20138 minutes, extend that out to 12\u201315 minutes.\nBut you didn\u2019t answer the question\u2026Is a morning gym workout \nbetter\n for the health of your spine than an evening gym workout?\nDone correctly, both early morning workouts and evening workouts are fine for your spinal health.\n \nIf you\u2019re working out in the morning, you\u2019ll just need to pay more attention to your preparation before you start crushing heavy weights at the gym.\n \nTrust me, it\u2019s worth paying a little more attention and not just jumping into 1RM deadlifts or squats in the morning, in order to keep your spine injury and pain-free.\n \nAgain, the reason why I\u2019m saying this is that suffering a debilitating back injury really sidelines you, and will make your life absolutely miserable.\n \nTrust me, this happened to me about 12 years ago\u2014back when I was foolishly squatting heavy at 6:30am before classes (and before knowing this information).\nFinal thoughts\nLike I mentioned earlier, this answer can be taken in many different directions. \n\u201cBetter\u201d\n can mean a lot of different things; so I opted to go with what I think is the most important topic to talk about\u2014the health of your spine.\n \nI don\u2019t want this answer to scare you out of working out in the morning, though.\n \nThat\u2019s not my intent.\n \nMy intent is to simply highlight things you need to be aware of, if you are in fact going to workout in the morning.\n \nI hope this answer helps give you a little better idea about keeping your spine healthy during early morning workouts.\nSources for this knowledge\nMost of the knowledge I have learned about spinal mechanics has come from the various work of Dr. Stuart McGill.\n \nDr. McGill is the world\u2019s leading expert in spinal biomechanics. He\u2019s definitely an individual you should listen to regarding spinal health. If you Google his name you\u2019ll find dozens of articles that he\u2019s published about the spine. My suggestion: give a few of them a read."

Last year i was 130lbs and now 153lbs.\n \nWhat matters is what you do for rest of the 22 hours.\n \nI sometime workout in the morning and i unable to lift very heavy because of less food. My body is just trained and used to it for evening workout.\n \nYour diet should be on point (With cheat meal once or twice a week) if you want good physique. I sleep at least 9 hours. I drink lots of water during the day. I don\u2019t drink, maybe once a month. I don\u2019t eat junk food. I prepare my meals on Sunday.\n \nYou have to put in some work to build good physique. It\u2019s 100% worth it. I just came back from physical check up. My blood press is low which is great. My Heart is very healthy. The cholesterol level check is on point. Blood Sugar is good. Ear H2o is perfect.\n \nBecause i workout in the evening, i am very careful what type of food i eat until 4pm. i don\u2019t need energy (Carbs) so i eat small amount of carbs, fat and bunch of protein.\n \nMy breakfast is very very light and quick. I make smoothies in the morning. Again, i love to sleep in the morning till 8am so i always find an opportunity to get out of the door quickly.\n \n8:30am: Smoothies include 1 cup egg whites, 1/2 cup oats, 1 scoop protein powder, 1 tb spoon chia seed, lots of spinach and blueberries.\n \n10:30: I make Kodiak pancake with 2 eggs in the morning while drinking smoothie. It\u2019s very quick.\n \n1:00pm: 5 oz Chicken and broccoli. Sometimes i throw in yams on a heavy day like back or legs.\n \n4:00pm I eat half pita bread or Yams with 5 oz chicken or shrimp. I start introducing carbs now for energy.\n \nWorkout\n \n7:30pm: I go home and make a quick smoothie again. 1 cup oats, 1 scoop protein powder and egg whites.\n \n8:00pm: 7 oz steak or salmon with green beans or green peppers.\n \nTotal Macro: 220P, 192C, 52F\n \nI recently started doing 20 minutes cardio after lifting. I lift 6 days a week and Sunday is rest and meal prep day. I do HIIT twice a week to really get shredded.\n \nHonestly,\n Working out and getting fit is like trial and error. You have to know your body. What fits for you might not work for me. You will not know until you try.\n \nFollow me on Instagram\n nickfitfreak\n if you want to see workout videos and my meals.\n \nHappy to help if you have any question. Happy Lifting."

Pick a time that you can do the most consistently, then worry about 'optimizing' if at all.\nI'm going to address a few fallacies I've skimmed over so far, then I'll get to the meat of my answer in terms of what really matters.\n \n1 - Working out doesn't 'jump-start' your metabolism. Exercise certainly \nadds\n \nadditional energy output\n as it relates to metabolism (See: \nWhat are the best ways to recover or improve my metabolism?\n) but that doesn't mean 'jumpstart.' Being awake in the first place burns more energy, eating a meal burns energy, but they don't 'jumpstart' metabolism either. They just contribute to daily energy expenditure.\n \nThe same amount and type of exercise done at a different part of the day will essentially have the same effect on your metabolism overall.\n \nIt does generally improve mood and energy though. Especially at moderate intensities (aerobic exercise for instance).\n \n2 - Not everybody 'feels' energized \nall day\n from exercising in the morning (\nI certainly don't\n), the boost it provides to energy/mood is usually only as short as a few hours. It also takes roughly 3 hours for body temperature to increase to highly functioning levels anyway, so you might get an endorphin boost until temperature levels hit peak, that carries you through to the early afternoon (\nso a good portion of the day\n) but most people will still experience a lull in early afternoon (1-2 PM-ish), despite exercising in the morning. \n \nYou might actually do better exercising just before lull that to reduce it's impact. And for other reasons I'll get to below...\n \n3 - Exercise does increase memory retention and cognitive function, but these benefits are not limited to a window of 4-10 hours. Exercising in the morning doesn't increase this benefit according to any research I'm familiar with. Furthermore, you wouldn't be wasting those benefits even if there was such a window as most long-term memory retention and cognitive improvement benefits happen during sleep. \n \nRead \nSpark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain\n, but I don't remember it indicating such a window, nor any of the research I read following it up; If anything, closer to exercise would still be better for the several studies done on how subjects perform better on tests done very soon after exercise. The effects on the brain overall however, appear to stick quite well no matter the time.\n \n4 - If you work early in the morning, then it might absolutely be a problem to get up 30-60 minutes before that. I used to start my work day at 6 AM, up at five, technically when I should be in my deepest sleep, now I'm supposed to get up 30-60 before that? So 4-4:30...which means getting to bed at 8-8:30 PM to get eight hours of sleep, which is generally just after when circadian rhythm makes most people the most alert. \n \nFor anyone other than true larks (small percentage of the population), this is a very daunting task. Sure if you start your work day at 9 AM, getting up at 7 to do a quick workout before work might not be so tough and it might often be better for a lot of folks to get it out of the way before their day gets away from them. Mental fatigue from many decisions throughout the day can make it tough to get to the gym after work for A LOT of people, if it isn't already a routine.\n \nHowever, all of this doesn't make it the best or worst time to train, it totally depends on you the person. Your existing routines, your natural circadian rhythm bias (some are larks, some are night owls, most are in between), your work schedule, your family schedule, etc...etc...\nFor more details on how to discover something that works for you then I highly recommend you read these (disclaimer: My Blog...):\n \nHelp! When Should I Train? (Part I) - Skill Based Fitness\n \n \nHelp! When Should I Train? (Part II) - Skill Based Fitness\n \nFirst, generally speaking consistency matters more than anything else. So if you can make yourself more consistent by getting up in the morning and get it out of the way, then sure that would make working out in the morning better...\nfor you...\n \nThis still wouldn't make it better for everyone else.\n \nThat's first and foremost the most important thing; Training at a time that works for you.\n \nIt is easier for a lot of people to skip workouts later in the day and so working out in the morning does often work very well for a lot of people, \nbut physiologically that doesn't make it ideal. \nAnd it doesn't have to be\n immediately\n upon waking either, just enough time to get it done before you get into a lot of cognitive loading work that might later hinder your ability to desire to go to the gym in the first place. It's the same reason productivity gurus tell you to get your most cognitive tasks out of the way early in the day. \n \nActually there may actually be some inherent risks to training within the first 3 hours of waking, particularly if you are say lifting weight or doing explosive work. Less so for endurance/aerobic training.\n \nFrom sleeping all night (horizontal position), the fluid in your spine actually displaces, slightly destabilizing your spine for the first part of the day. This might be associated with injury potential (at least for heavily loaded movements involving the spine). Not only that but nervous system function, muscular blood flow, glucose metabolism and joint mobility at this time of day aren't really that conducive to training.  All of them are limited first in the morning, which is why most world records in sports are not broken first thing in the morning, they are generally broken in early evening.\n \nYou'd be hard pressed to find many strength or power athletes that successfully do the bulk of their training early in the morning (\nsome will start at 10-11 AM\n). There may be some early morning skates, serving practice or shooting practice, but these are usually low intensity and/or optimized to suit the schedules of student-athletes and break up the training day (\nfor twice-a-day training purposes\n).\n \nThis generally doesn't apply as heavily to the endurance athletes, who often have early start times to deal with mid-afternoon heat, but they would probably still perform better if it was done in the early evening (\nit would just be hotter out still in many climates\n). \n \nAgain schedules optimized to the person and the objective, not necessarily the physiological optimized times.\n \nA physiologically optimized (i.e. derive the most benefit from for performance purposes and anabolism) training window for most people (\ndepending on their circadian rhythm\n) is probably anywhere from about 2:30-3 PM in the afternoon (\njust after your circadian dip\n) to about 6:30-7 PM at night. \n \nYes peak circadian rhythm in most people is closer to 8, which is when you might be inclined or think to be ideal. However, training late generally makes it difficult to fall asleep for 2-3 hours post-workout due to hormone fluctuations, so the later in the day you push it the longer you might end staying up. I used to have volleyball practice from 9-11PM in school, and I could never fall asleep before 1AM as a result, which wrecked havoc on my school schedule.\n \nAgain, here \nI am\n speaking from a fairly pure physiological point of view, if you can't do that, or it impedes you from actually training, you're better off doing what makes you the most consistent. The differences are probably physiologically negligible (I'm throwing out a guess of less than 10-15% difference) long-term, except training first thing in the morning is actually pretty terrible for performance purposes (\nwhich isn't necessarily the same as training...\n). It would also probably increase training injury risk slightly for weight training/explosive training. \n \nIt would on the other hand make sense if you competed early in the morning, to move your training to early in the morning to acclimatize for your performances.\n \nTypically if performance is required or the intensity of training is high, wait at least 3 hours, and maybe even preferably six if you can. If it's just aerobic exercise, endurance, then do it whenever is convenient.\n \nThere are other influencers too. For instance if you have a high stress, high cognitive load job (lawyer, doctor, entrepreneur, technician, engineer, etc...) then you might be more likely to skip training the later in the day you leave it. If you have a lower cognitive load job (autopilot repetitive tasks, manual labour, factory work, etc...) then you might have the mental reserve to better tolerate training later in the day.\n \nUltimately, the best time to work out during the day depends on you."

For myself, I find I'm about 20% weaker compared to if I worked out at lunch or after work.\nI've  done all the above. My current routine is right before bed. It's  working out well for me: I sometimes have problems sleeping and I find  hard workouts is a great sleeping aid. Plus the gym is usually not busy  so I can do circuits without needing to share workout equipment.\n \nBut I'm a unique case. Try out a time, and if it doesn't work try another time until you find what works for you."

In fact training in a \u201cfasted state\u201d (that means with no food eaten for at least 12 hours or more) is probably the \nmost beneficial for weight loss.\n \nThe body has finite storage capacity and will \nnever use fat while you still have stored glucose energy (glycogen for those that love the science)\n \nIt just would not do that.\n \nIf you are trying to \nbuild muscle while staying lean \nthen you need to keep a close eye on protein. \nHigh protein is pointless \n(unless your are selling protein shakes and bars!) The body can not store excess protein. Again it\u2019s the body having finite storage capacity. Anything over roughly 2 chicken legs worth of protein per meal is simply going be turned to glucose or even worse; fat. \nSo moderate protein intake is required. THERE IS NO BEST TIME TO EAT ONLY BEST TIME TO NOT EAT! \nLeaving at least an hour before and after is best.\n \nSidebar: everyone has heard of human growth hormone, it\u2019s the bodys \u2018repair and rebuild\u2019 hormone. When you wake up HGH is high, and lowers when you start eating. If you buzz to the gym and take some water with a pinch of pink Himalayan salt with you then you can workout with the elevated human growth hormone still circulating. The salted water is the best for rehydration.\n \nHydration is often thought of as loss of water, it\u2019s actually loss of electrolytes that\u2019s the issue. Hence the pink salt.\n \nLastly some think water increases metabolic rate. It does, temporarily. But this is only because the body works to bring the temperature of the cold water up to body temperature. If you really want to be geeky about training \nnever drink cold water unless it is to bring your temperature down. It\u2019s a 3% lose of workout energy while it raise the water temperature up.\n \nIt\u2019s really minimal though.\n \nBut to answer your question in a more basic way\n \nThe best time to go is when suits you best. All that above might scientifically help but if you FEEL better at night then you\u2019ll probably get more out of it then dragging yourself there reluctantly in the morning.\n \nIf you don\u2019t mind either then you need to focus on what your goal is.

This is because early in the morning is usually devoid of sudden commitments. Compare this to afternoon and evening workouts, when responsibilities may arise. Furthermore, a full day\u2019s work can take a toll on our willpower, thus deterring us from going to the gym.\nBetter sleep\n: Since exercise increases heart rate and body temperature, working out too late in the evening (generally after 8 p.m.) may disrupt sleep.

This is because early in the morning is usually devoid of sudden commitments. Compare this to afternoon and evening workouts, when responsibilities may arise. Furthermore, a full day\u2019s work can take a toll on our willpower, thus deterring us from going to the gym.\nBetter sleep\n: Since exercise increases heart rate and body temperature, working out too late in the evening (generally after 8 p.m.) may disrupt sleep. On the other hand, one study showed that working out at 7 a.m. (compared to 1 p.m. or 7 p.m.) may help people sleep more soundly at night.\nAvoiding crowds: \nFitness centers see the most traffic between 5 and 8 p.m., making it difficult to get the machine or group fitness class you really want. Mornings see less traffic, making A.M. workouts more efficient. Furthermore, early morning gym-goers tend to get in and get out within a fixed amount of time, leaving no room for socialization and clogging up the gym floor.\nStarting the day right:\n When you start a daily routine with exercise, you are more likely to set yourself up for a healthy domino effect throughout the day. Say, for example, you start the day at the gym. This is often followed by a healthy post-workout shake or snack and an increased water intake all morning long. Getting your workout in the morning makes it easier to incorporate a balanced breakfast into your schedule, setting you up for a day of healthy eating.\nWorking out in the P.M.\nStrength:\n If you are not a morning person, then you will definitely have more strength working out in the afternoon or the evening. After all, if you struggle to wake up in the first place, working out in the morning can result in the inability to concentrate (and injury!), which will decrease workout quality. On the opposite side of the coin, an individual who works out later in the day has the opportunity to eat and fuel his body for a tough workout.\nStress relief: \nMany people see exercise as a way to express their pent up stress throughout the day. Having an outlet, such as a kickboxing or personal training, at the end of the workday can provide a healthy way to release daily stresses.\nAccountability: \nIt\u2019s generally easier to find a workout partner or personal trainer who is willing to meet you for an afternoon or evening workout than one who\u2019s up for a 5 or A.M. weightlifting session.\nAvailability:\n While it is true that avoiding the crowds is a plus for many early morning gym-goers, the exact same reason can be a negative for other individuals. Gyms offer a larger variety of classes after work than in the morning hours. Plus, a packed post-work class may push you to compete against fellow gym-goers and work harder to get the most from your routine.\nWhat about RESULTS?\n \nIn terms of results, current studies suggest that \nworking out in the morning or in the evening can work just as well\n, depending on the individual. \nIt all comes down to workout quality and performance.\n \nAfter all, the advantages of working out in the morning vs evening all comes down to personal preference. \nThe most objective parameter is your individual performance\n. Other than that, no substantial research suggests that one is definitely better than the other.\n \nSo what should you do if you want to workout in the morning?\n \nYou should workout in the morning if:\nYou are a morning person. I.e. you feel energized and fresh enough early in the morning.\nYou feel fine working out in a fasted state. While you can still consume your pre-workout supplement, generally people who work out in the morning opt to have a proper breakfast after their workout session.\nYou should workout in the afternoon or evening if:\nYou are not a morning person.\nYour performance is impaired when training with an empty stomach. Indeed, most individuals find they perform better in the evening because they had a chance to get some meals in earlier in the day.\nDiscovering which one works best for you is easy: try both, and see how your body reacts in comparison. Good luck :D"

You go to office, work with all the energy that your body witnessed earlier that day, and shine like the sun. You come back home, have enough spare time to indulge in some or the other hobby. Sleep peacefully.\n \nCase 2: \nEvening workout\n \nYou wake up (late, comparatively!), freshen up, have your breakfast and are off to work. You are active as you are usually, with the usual amount of energy amd spark on your face. You come back home, think you have to go to the gym now after such a tiring day. Someday, you procrastinate and lie on the bed instead and someday, you get your ass up after much discussion with yourself and train hard as you normally do. You come back home, tired as ever with no time and energy left for some other activity.\n \nYou observe the difference up there? I don't feel the need to explain this more.\n \nTalking about the diet plan in the case of morning workout, you have a plus point, that is, you get to intake more amount of healthy food before going to the gym in the morning, which is, an additional meal. After coming back from the gym, have a protein-oriented breakfast, a bit more than your appetite. Have small meals at regular intervals to keep the metabolism rate perfect and immune system active. Eat less in your dinner as compared to your lunch and have it atleast before 2 hours of going to bed.\n \nIf you still have some queries, you can message me anytime and I will revert back to you ASAP.\n \nP.S.: I'm not at all saying that evening workouts are bad or anything against, in fact, when I have to run to work early, I'm left with no other option but to train in evening which is not bad either. All I say is, morning workouts are better than the evening ones.\n \nThanks."

If you exercise late in the night and don't follow that with food, then that highly beneficial period is likely to be wasted.\n \nThat being said, if you can't consistently exercise in the morning, then evening exercise is a good way to go.

It also gets my system fired up and makes me a bit more alert in the morning. However, I know people that work out at the end of the day and they have many good reasons for doing it that way too. Try both and see which works better for you!"

A longer gap between the last meal and the workout, combined with more available oxygen if the workout is in a ventilated area or outdoors all help burn calories. It's also useful in pumping freshly oxygenated blood to the brain, first thing in the morning and in getting the fitness objective ticked on your checklist.\n \nAn evening workout is useful to build on a somewhat warmed up body and to remove the stress of the day's routine. It takes a different meal time adjustment from the person going for a morning workout. The cool down phase of the workout needs to be longer/slower in an evening workout since the air temperature tends to cool the body faster. (Not applicable if one works out in an air conditioned gym.) This is also useful for those whose routines involve late nights.\n \nAs an aside, the key to waking early is to eat 2 hours or more before hitting bed. Sleeping on a full stomach tends to restrict proper digestion and affects oxidation (burning) of food. This causes reduced oxygen in the blood and the brain suffers from grogginess by the morning."

Think of it like a 3-hour computer system reboot.\n \nNot to mention your spinal fluids are not in an advantageous position for loading after being horizontal for the morning. So some kind of spinal flossing for morning workouts is always a good idea.\n \nAll that being said, the time you can actually train will always work better than the time you can\u2019t.\n \nJust because late afternoon/early evening is the ideal time to express strength as a quality, doesn\u2019t mean a thing if you can\u2019t and don\u2019t train at that time because the time is bad for you.\n \nTraining in the morning gets it out of the way for most people before other aspects of their lives take over and prevent regular training from occurring. Consistency will trump time of day no matter what and many people find morning better for that reason.\n \nThey may never get as \u2018strong\u2019 but rarely is maximum strength really all that important anyway. The average lifter isn\u2019t working towards a world record in anything. For muscle gains, I\u2019m not convinced it matters. You need even more consistency for muscle hypertrophy. I still think you will train better later in the day but that isn\u2019t convenient for a lot of people. So even if you\u2019re 10% stronger at that time, in the grand scheme of things it won\u2019t mean a thing for 95% of the population.\n \nTrain at the time that is most convenient for you because elite athletes don\u2019t ask questions like this on Quora. They are already training in the late morning and early afternoons twice a day."

When you first wake up, you haven\u2019t started tackling the day\u2019s \nto-do list\n. You\u2019re also less likely to get phone calls, text messages, and emails.\n \nWith fewer distractions, you\u2019re more likely to follow through with your workout.\nBeat the heat.\nIn the summer, working out in the morning will feel more comfortable, as the hottest part of the day is 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It\u2019s recommended to avoid outdoor exercise during this time.\n \nIf you prefer outdoor activities, it\u2019s best to work out in the early morning, especially on very hot days.\nIncreased alertness.\nA morning workout may be a better match for your body\u2019s hormonal fluctuations.\n \nCortisol is a hormone that keeps you awake and alert. It\u2019s often called the stress hormone, but it only causes problems when there\u2019s too much or too little of it.\n \nTypically, cortisol increases in the early morning hours and drops in the evening. It reaches its peak around 8 a.m. If you have a healthy circadian rhythm, your body might be more primed to exercise at this time.\nBetter focus.\nPhysical activity also improves \nfocus and concentration\n, regardless of when you do it. But if you have trouble focusing during the day, a morning workout might be just the ticket.\n \nA 2019 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that morning exercise improves attention, visual learning, and decision-making.\n \nIn the study, participants completed a round of 8-hour days of prolonged sitting with and without a 30-minute morning walk on the treadmill. On some days, they also took 3-minute walking breaks every 30 minutes.\n \nThe days with morning exercise were associated with better cognition throughout the day, especially when paired with regular breaks.\n \nIf a morning workout does not fit into your schedule, make it a point to move actively in the evening!\n \nA well-structured 45-minute fitness routine done four times a day is more than enough to help you seek its benefits."

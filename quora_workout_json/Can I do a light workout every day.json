Holding my arms up like this is exhausting.\u201d\n \n\u2026\n \nI hope you know none of that\u2019s true.\n \nI do pump myself up before a big lift sometimes.\n \nIt can indeed be awkward.\n \nSlaps are given. Music is played. Grunts are, embarrassing as it is in retrospect, made.\n \nBut while I use it as a tool, I don\u2019t rely on feelings of motivation, for reasons we\u2019re about to get to.\n \nThe term motivation is used and abused too much and too vaguely. Before we can talk about it, we need to firmly define what it means.\n \nWhen discussing others, most agree that motivation is \nthe desire that drives their actions.\n \nSimple, right?\n \nBut when we\u2019re talking about ourselves\u2014and perhaps most specifically when we speak of notoriously hard to improve aspects of our lives\u2014that\u2019s \nnot\n the meaning we give it.\n \nWe then start mixing it up, with this mythical \nfeeling \nthat will be able to generate the energy required for us to behave in a particular way.\n \nWe tend to also treat it as a prerequisite; as if this feeling has to be present before we do a given thing.\n \n\u201cI\u2019m not motivated today.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhen am I going to be motivated again?\u201d\n \n\u201cI need some motivation before I start.\u201d\n \nNotice however, that nowhere in the first definition does it say that one has to \nfeel\n motivation. It only speaks of the desire driving action. If I told you Usain Bolt was motivated to train for the Olympics, that only means he has a goal he values in his sights\u2014not that every moment of his experience is filled with feelings of motivation. Point being, that \nthese two definitions of motivation are not the same thing.\n \nAnd that is a \nvery\n good thing.\nContrary to how we treat them, feelings aren\u2019t instructions we should follow, sent from the deep, all-knowing core inside of us.\n \nThere is at least no evidence of that.\n \nThe unsexy, best guess of a truth we currently have is that\n feelings are our brains best interpretations of outward stimuli \nbased on our personal biology, history, personality, expectations and culture.\n[1]\n \n[2]\n \n[3]\n \n[4]\n \nAlso, as the high-school version of me would tell you: feelings are fickle beasts.\n \nNot constant, but fluctuating.\n \nNot rational, but irrational.\n \nNo one feels pulsating motivation \nall the time,\n just like no one feels constant anger, happiness or joy.\n \nDoing something you\u2019re not used to doing, it\u2019s in fact very likely you\u2019ll not \nfeel\n much motivation\u2014at least at first. Rarely do we like doing that we\u2019re bad at.\n \nSo \n\u201cmotivation the feeling\u201d\n shouldn\u2019t matter.\n \nWhat should is the \noverarching desire\n that drives our actions, even\u2014and perhaps especially\u2014when we don\u2019t particularly feel like performing those actions.\n \nWhat drives people to train everyday and what we need isn\u2019t \nmotivation\n, but \ndedication\n.\n \nDedication, to a goal we\u2019ve set ourselves.\n \nDedication, to being who we want to be.\n \nDedication, to what \nmotivates us\n.\n \nNo one wants to eat vegetables, drag themselves to the gym and go to bed early. These are not sexy, fun or appealing things to do. The only reason why some do them is because they\u2019re dedicated to an overarching goal, desire or way of life they value.\n \nBut is doing whatever you want to do going to be a constant uphill battle? Are you never going to like it?\n \nThe good news is that\u2019s highly unlikely.\n \nIf you\u2019re anything like most people, you\u2019ll enjoy it more and more the more time you spend doing it.\n \nAs stated, we like doing things we\u2019re good at and we become good at that which we do. It\u2019s a \npositive feedback loop.\nOne action spurs another, which again spurs the original action.\n \nFurthermore, we mostly don\u2019t operate based on momentary desire. Virtually no one contemplates how they feel about brushing their teeth or weighs the pros and cons of cutting their nails.\n \nDoing so would be exhausting and extremely inefficient.\n \nMost of our decisions are made blindly, out of habit. That which we do everyday is treated just as things to be done. Exercise becomes very much the same way.\n \nIt\u2019s also important to notice how motivation and dedication are not on opposite sides of the spectrum. One does not take away from the other. In fact, they\u2019re symbiotic, feeding off of each other.\n \nThe stronger your motivation\u2014being the \nthing\n, the \ngoal\n, the \ndesire\n that motivates you\u2014the easier it is to dedicate yourself to it. The more you\u2019re able to dedicate yourself to something, the more motivated you\u2019ll feel, because you\u2019re now accomplishing what motivates you, and few things are more motivating than sensing progress towards a goal we value.\n \nMost often, it works like this in practice:\nFind something that motivates you.\n As we\u2019ve gone over, this doesn\u2019t mean something you\u2019ll enjoy doing 100% of the time, but simply something that\u2019ll make you happy/successful in the long run.\nDedicate yourself to it.\n You\u2019ll inevitably, for a moment or 100, not want to do it. Do it anyway.\nDo it for a long enough time that it becomes ingrained. \nYou\u2019ll have to fight less and less to do it. Some days, you\u2019ll still have to though. That\u2019s life.\nToo many people accept blindly the idea that they need to feel motivated to do something. That which we decide as true shape our vision of the world.\n \nIf reaching your goal is something that\u2019s important to you, I strongly recommend leaving that crowd and the idea that feelings of motivation are a prerequisite for action behind.\n \nDon\u2019t depend on a fleeting feeling. Depend on what will make you happiest in the long run.\n \nMotivation will come and go.\n \nIt rises, like the ocean, then it sinks again.\n \nAnd you\u2019ll be there. Still going strong. Still working.\n \nWith it.\n \nWithout it.\nTo answer your question directly: No one feels motivated to workout every day. People simply do so because of their habits, environment and identity. If you want to be more consistent in the gym, those are the things you should aim to change, not your feelings of motivation.\nFootnotes\n[1] \nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/feeling-our-emotions/\n[2] \nWhy Your Biology Runs on Feelings - Issue 56: Perspective - Nautilus\n[3] \nhttps://humdev.uchicago.edu/sites/humdev.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shweder/2008--The%20Cultural%20Psychology%20of%20the%20Emotions%20-%20Ancient%20and%20Renewed.PDF\n[4] \nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.577.4057&rep=rep1&type=pdf"

You could set experience \novertraining syndrome\n, where your body cannot recover enough between workouts.\n \nAdditionally, your body requires a certain amount of time to recover between workouts. If you\u2019re providing enough stimulus to your muscles this is usually between 36 and 48 hours (\ndepending on the muscle worked (muscles like your core tend to recover faster\n), your gender (\nwomen tend to recover faster than men)\n, the intensity that you worked the muscle (\nthe harder you worked it the longer it will take)\n, your age (\nover 60 you will require as much as 96 hours rest to recover between workouts), \nthe nutrition applied, and your hormone profile (\nmore testosterone, HGH, IGF will lead to quicker recovery when coupled with adequate amounts of protein and glucose\n)).\nIf you don\u2019t give it enough time, you won\u2019t build up past your initial baseline, and your muscles will suffer.\n \nAs metabolic fatigue builds up, even in lighter intensity training, you\u2019ll feel it all over. It could be something simple at first \u2014 you stop improving in your lifts, for example. Eventually you start getting worse. Soon you start getting injuries that aren\u2019t healing. You start to feel depressed. Even one day off with complete relaxation or even a light walk could be enough to clear you out, if you catch it early enough. Serious cases of overtraining could require more time.\n \nTo re-iterate:\nIf you don\u2019t work it over 80% intensity every day\nIf you \ndo\n take a break once every 1\u20132 weeks\nYou\u2019ll be fine.\n \nIf you notice things going wrong \u2014 you start feeling weaker, you stop improving, you start feeling like crap in general, you start getting injuries\u2026take a step back. Rest. Recover.\nBrief anecdote as illustration\n \nOnce I was really working my pull ups. I was stuck at 18. I would do them daily, at least 4 sets. I hit 18 every time in my first set, I ended up doing about 50 a day. At first I was gaining daily, I went from 8 to 10 to 14, to 18\u2026but then the growth stopped. I was stuck there for a couple weeks.\n \nI took 2 days off from doing pull ups.\n \nThe next time I stepped up to the bar I did 25 in my first set.\n \nI\u2019m not saying that you\u2019ll have dramatic results like this, but sometimes the missing part of your workout is actually \nnot\n working out."

If your goal is to increase the muscle tone of your legs and general fitness, then training your legs everyday with lights would be doable.\n \nHowever, if your goal is more ambitious- to increase leg size and definition- then daily leg workouts performed at a heavy weight would not be a good thing to do.\n \nWhenever you're serious about your gains, especially when it comes to gaining size and strength, you must always take the progressive overload principle into account. It is an adaptation of Hans Selye\u2019s General Adaptation Syndrome.\n \nWhen you train with heavier weights, your muscles will incur more damage and consequently need more time to recover. And it\u2019s only after the muscle recovers, does it begin to adapt and grow in size and strength.\n \nIf you perform heavy leg workouts every day, you deny the muscles a chance to recover. And when you deny recovery, you also deny the legs the potential to grow bigger. This is called overtraining.\n \nThe generally recommended rest period is 24 to 48 hours per muscle between workouts. I know when I used to be a powerlifter, and was squatting between 600 and 700 lbs drug-free, because of the heavy weights involved, There would be weeks when I needed a full week to recover.\n \nFor the average beginner, working your legs every day with heavy weights will likely result in overtraining. And this would be counterproductive to making strength and muscle gains."

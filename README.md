# 🏋️‍♂️ Quora Web Scraping: Workout & Fitness Q&A

This project focuses on scraping workout and fitness-related questions and answers from **Quora** using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**. The goal was to extract valuable content related to fitness, resulting in around **30 JSON files** containing structured Q&A data.

After scraping, the data from all JSON files was concatenated into a unified format for better visualization and analysis, creating a structured dataset of question-answer pairs.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used:

- **JSON**: For handling data storage and manipulation of scraped Q&A data.
- **Selenium**: Automates the web browser for interacting with Quora's Q&A pages.
- **webdriver_manager**: For managing and installing the ChromeDriver needed to control the browser.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML content and extracting useful information.
- **time**: To manage scraping delays and ensure the process adheres to responsible scraping practices.

## 🗂️ Project Workflow:
1. **Web Scraping**: Selenium is used to automate browser actions and retrieve raw HTML data from Quora pages.
2. **HTML Parsing**: BeautifulSoup parses the HTML and extracts the relevant question-answer content.
3. **Data Storage**: The extracted data is stored in JSON format for further processing.
4. **Data Concatenation**: The individual JSON files are combined to form a complete dataset of question-answer pairs.

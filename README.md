Quora Web Scraping: Workout &amp; Fitness Q&amp;A
In this project, I scraped workout and fitness-related questions and answers from Quora using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. I collected approximately 30 JSON files containing Q&A data. After scraping, I concatenated the JSON files and created a structured format of question-answer pairs for better visualization.

Technologies and Libraries Used:

json: for handling data storage and manipulation.
selenium: for automating the web browser to interact with Quora.
webdriver_manager: to manage and install the ChromeDriver.
BeautifulSoup :for parsing HTML and extracting data.
time: for managing the timing and delays in scraping.
